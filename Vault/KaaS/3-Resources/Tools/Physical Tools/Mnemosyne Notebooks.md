**FUN FACT** - *Mnemosyne* is the Greek Goddess of Memory!

 > 
 > In Greek mythology, **Mnemosyne** (; Ancient Greek: Μνημοσύνη, pronounced \[mnɛːmosýːnɛː\]) is the goddess of memory and the mother of the nine Muses. The term Mnemosyne is derived from the same source as the word mnemonic, that being the Greek word mnēmē, which means "remembrance, memory".
