- PowerShell Scripting and ToolMaking Know who will use the tool and how they will use it. What will be their expectation?Write one type of object to the pipeline.Use full cmdlet and parameter names in your scripts. No aliases.Be flexible and modular. Always think about re-use.Don’t hard code yourself into a corner. Aim for flexibility.Documentation is critical and not just internal comments.Use the Verb-Noun naming convention for your function and commonly accepted parameter names. Don’t re-invent the wheel.Use meaningful variable names that don’t use Hungarian notation. $strComputername is bad. $Computername is good.Standardize script layout with templates and snippets. Especially important in team environments.White space and formatting is your friend. VSCode can format your scripts for you. Use it.Write your code for the next person. It could be you.Include Write-Verbose messages from the beginning. They will help you develop your code.Learn how to use Write-Progress in place of Write-Host to provide execution details.Avoid using the value localhost as a default parameter value. Use $env:computername which will always resolve to a “real” name. If you need to script cross-platform you can use [environment]::machinename.Just because you can use a long, one-line pipelined expression doesn’t mean you should.Separate the data you need to run your code from the code itself.Avoid using .NET code when a cmdlet will work.Recognize that sometimes PowerShell is not the right solution or tool for the task at hand.Test your code in a PowerShell session with no profile. Even better, test in a virtual machine of the Windows Sandbox to avoid unintended dependencies.Understand the PowerShell paradigm. Don’t write a VBScript using PowerShell commands and think you’re done.If you are creating a graphical PowerShell tool, start with a console-based script or function that already works.Your first step in creating a new script or function is to read help and examples. Not Google or Bing.Leverage splatting to simplify your code.Think about how your code will scale. Don’t write a function that only works with one remote computer. How would you write it to work with 10 or 100 or 1000? Think “managing at scale”.If you need credentials in your script or function use a PSCredential type parameter. Never a username and plain text password.Learn how to use the Platyps module to create help documentation for commands in your PowerShell module. — [Updated on 2022-08-28 18:46:30](https://hyp.is/QjQc1CcjEe20C0NzYoT0HA/jdhitsolutions.com/blog/powershell-tips-tricks-and-advice/)  — Group: #Development
