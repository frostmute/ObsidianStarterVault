## Highlights

* Event storming catalyzes and accelerates group learning, often achieving in a few hours or days what more traditional modeling techniques never doâ€”a common understanding of the domain in which the software must operate.
* To understand event storming you first need to understand two key terms. A domain event is anything that happens that is of interest to a domain expert. The domain expert is not interested in databases, web sockets, or design patterns, but in the business domain of the things that have to happen. Domain events capture those facts in a way that doesn't specify a particular implementation. How event storming works
* When and where to use event storming
* The most obvious time to use event storming is at a project's inception, so the team can start with a common understanding of the domain model.
* Another high-payoff time to use event storming is as part of a project's close, to capture and share what the team learned in the process of building the software.
