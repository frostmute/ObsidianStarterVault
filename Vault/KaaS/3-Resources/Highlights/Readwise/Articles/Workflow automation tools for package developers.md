## Highlights

* R CMD check or devtools::check() will check your package for adherence to some standards (e.g., what folders can there be) and run the tests and examples. Itâ€™s a useful command to run even if your package isnâ€™t intended to go on CRAN.

* goodpractice and lintr both provide you with useful static analyses of your package.

  * covr::package\_coverage() calculates test coverage for your package. Having a good coverage also means R CMD check is more informative, since it means itâ€™s testing your code. ðŸ˜‰ covr::package\_coverage() can also provide you with the code coverage of the vignettes and examples!

* devtools::spell\_check(), wrapping spelling::spell\_check\_package(), runs a spell check on your package and lets you store white-listed words.

* styler can help you re-style your code. Of course, you should check the changes before putting them in your production codebase. Itâ€™s better paired with version control.

  * Note: :Favorites
* Using roxygen2 is generally handy, starting with your no longer needing to edit the NAMESPACE by hand. If your package doesnâ€™t use roxygen2 yet, you could use Rd2roxygen to convert the documentation.

* One could argue that using pkgdown is a way to improve your R package documentation for very little effort. If you only tweak one thing, please introduce grouping in the reference page.

* Even when having to write some things by hand like inventing new tests, usethis provides useful functions to help (e.g., create test files with usethis::use\_test()).

  * Note: :Favorites
* To take things further, the precommit R package provides two sets of utilities around the precommit framework: hooks that are useful for R packages or projects, and usethis-like functionalities to set them up.

  * Note: :Favorites
* CRAN has a submission checklist, and you could either roll your own or rely on usethis::use_release_issue() creating a GitHub issue with important items. If you donâ€™t develop your package on GitHub you could still have a look at the items for inspiration. The devtools::release() function will ask you whether you ran a spell check.
