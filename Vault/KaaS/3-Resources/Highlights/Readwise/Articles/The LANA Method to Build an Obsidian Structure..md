## Highlights

* Literature is a folder in which you create and store your literature notes. But it doesn’t have to be a literature note for every piece of material you read, listen to, or watch. If they all have the same purpose and try to answer the same question, you can also create a literature note collection — a literature note with multiple materials in it.
* Areas are folders dedicated to certain curiosities and interests of yours. I for example have created the areas/folders: learning, philosophy, emotions, and writing. These are the four main areas I’m interested in and read about.
* Notes are the typical notes you know. But instead of dumping them all into one notes folder, they are instead placed into the specific area (areas folder) that is most relevant. Inside the area, the note should be connected meaningfully to the rest of the notes. This also means restructuring, reorganizing, and rewriting notes if necessary. Don’t try to be a collector forcing notes into the area. Think about the network of content you already have and find a logical and meaningful place for new notes. I like to use the graph view filtered for the specific area to think inside my network of content.
* Archive is the place for your old notes. I didn’t want to migrate all my notes into the new structure. I also didn’t want to start from scratch and delete them all. I put all my previous notes inside an archive folder. The idea is that if I need something or remember a note I might have, I will go into the archive, pull it out from there, and move it to a specific area.
