## Highlights

* 1Think about your input system — How will “meaningful” information flow in your PKM? This is the information you want to interact with and grow. At first, everything feels meaningful, but of course, it isn’t. Capture “interesting” in your Quick Capture Inbox, and let it sit there. Revisit after a week (or two) and see if it's still interesting for you. Ask if it helps you expand your knowledge, if yes, move it into your PKM. In the above flow diagram, I’ve marked my inboxes.
* The more clutter inside your PKM, the less likely you’ll make notes.
* Permanent Notes/Atomic Notes: All your (original and handcrafted) notes live here.
* Readwise — This is a default if you read on Kindle and sync it to your notes app. I think this qualifies for literature notes, and it is helpful for reference.
* Posts/Newsletters — This is the output, I am writing this post inside my PKM right now. You could have a folder for this if you have a specific output in mind.
* 3 Note Making — Note-taking and note-making are very different. While note-taking involves transcribing, highlighting, or copy-pasting, note-making is strictly re-writing in your own words. It was difficult when I started because I’ve never made notes, but it gets easier with time. So what does a note look like?
* The notes are often called Permanent notes, Atomic Notes, or Evergreen notes, and it is one and the same thing.
* 4 Connecting notes — This is where the magic happens. When you spend time connecting notes, those neurons in your brain fire up. Once you start doing this consistently, you’re expanding your thinking and becoming smarter 🙂. I wish they taught this in school.
* 5 Reviewing and Updating Notes: This is where the Digital Gardener mindset will be useful — every note is W.I.P. Don’t let the term “Permanent Note” fool you. It isn’t permanent (like everything else).
* As mentioned in “Connecting Notes”, notes (and your PKM system) should be regularly edited and connected. Make time to review notes without connections and see if there is something relevant you can connect it with. Of course, the connection must be logical and shouldn’t be forced. Regularly spending time in “connecting notes” will make you good at it.
