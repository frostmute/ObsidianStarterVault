* @divadnojnarg: (2/4) Earning few JS skills for #RStats #shiny has loads of benefits:
  * Ease debugging (like {htmlwidgets} issues): https://t.co/Eitgrt8aG3.
  * Add new inputs/widgets: https://t.co/W9dR3IB65J
  * Optimize apps: less code from the server (R): https://t.co/ClqdAXok15

* @\_ColinFay: This week I gave the last session of a 4 days training on JavaScript for {shiny}. 
  Attendees were seasoned shiny devs, and were amazed by the extent of what you can do with {shiny} once you start mastering JS & understanding how both can work together. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/1532251620578410497))
* @\_ColinFay: If you stick to R wrappers for JS libs... that's probably 0,1% of what JS can offer. 
  Once you start mastering JS \<\> {shiny}, "the sky is the limit". Most of the time you can pick a JS lib online and plug it into your app. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/1532251622306357248))
* @\_ColinFay: Anyway, my number one advice for {shiny} devs is to start learning JS, and all the web technologies. That will def take your apps to the next level. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/1532251623648645120))
* @\_ColinFay: @TeslaDuBois Unfortunately it's an internal company training, so I can share the material as is, but here are some resources I would suggest :

* @\_ColinFay: That's it, it happened. I just coded a tool today that I had already coded 2 years ago, just because I had completely forgotten I had already coded it before. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/1535229205209808896))
* @\_ColinFay: {shiny} dev pro-tip : learn how to use options("shiny.trace" = TRUE). 
  It can save your life from time to time ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/1537412966710140936))
* @\_ColinFay: Before I start building one, is there a tool to work with conventional commits in #RStats ?

* @\_bcullen: #rstats friends: what are your favorite ‚Äúlesser known‚Äù tips & tricks for using R Markdown? e.g. any feature(s) (big or small) you‚Äôve picked up at some point along your #rmarkdown journey that you now use on a regular basis and wish you knew earlier? üëÄüëÇ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_bcullen/status/1333878752741191680))
* @lisalendway: @\_bcullen Likely not lesser known, but adding th code download option to the YAML header. I don‚Äôt know why I ever avoided telling my students about that ... now I require it! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/lisalendway/status/1333901941253033985))
* @apreshill: @lisalendway @\_bcullen Goodness same!!! https://t.co/kgCZIGzHlP ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/apreshill/status/1333975778040672256))
* @JennyBryan: @\_bcullen @juliesquid knitr::knit_exit() for figuring out where the deeply broken thing is by bisecting your Rmd
  https://t.co/u5AQZ6kKcc ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/1333897294714859521))
* @Shel_Kariuki: @\_bcullen Embedding links, especially on the YAML.

* @tjmahr: @\_bcullen use project-relative paths with here::here() to avoid any funny business like like report/main.Rmd not being able to see data/data.csv ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tjmahr/status/1334201305062105098))
* @grant_mcdermott: @\_bcullen Use pandoc's "fenced div" approach for multi-column environments that work consistently across output types. https://t.co/WmE12wRIXX 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EoNQkcDVQAINS_6.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/grant_mcdermott/status/1333998608547414016))
* @BeaMilz: @\_bcullen knitr::combine_words() 
  I learned this function recently and used quite some times! 
  https://t.co/WENzMmZIS1 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BeaMilz/status/1333898698829549578))
* @d_olivaw: @\_bcullen @apreshill Use the opts_chunk$set(cache.exta = 1) to invalidate all cache and start fresh. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/d_olivaw/status/1333993099194982400))
* @DrewWalkerr: @\_bcullen @juliesquid Just discovered knitr::purl() which converts your rmd to an r script w/same title, super helpful when trying to make your analysis executable by a batch file or the like! 
  https://t.co/2J3bClEeRS ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrewWalkerr/status/1333898571721138180))
* @brshallo: @\_bcullen knitr::knit_code() is something I think is pretty nifty. @statsgen has a great post on it: https://t.co/lzxDyhUdJp . I use it indirectly via the `flair` and `flipbookr` packages for communicating code (these use knitr::knit_code() in the background to do their magic). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/brshallo/status/1333881802490925056))
* @chendaniely: @\_bcullen xaringan::inf_mr(cast_from = "../..")
  to be able to reference figures outside your rmd working directory in xaringan
  pagedown::chrome_print("something.html")
  to print your slides without opening chrome ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chendaniely/status/1339662339965136898))
* @chrisderv: @\_bcullen Use the asis knitr engine to conditionally add text content in a document. Very useful for multiple output format or combined with parametrized report to generate different text content from the same Rmd source. 
  https://t.co/qtnBOm5GWc ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/chrisderv/status/1334272208085114882))
* @GoldbergData: @\_bcullen knit_child() let‚Äôs you define a template Rmarkdown and you can loop over arguments and recreate that structure.
  Use case: Imagine you have a document with an intro section and then many subsections that follow a similar structure. knit_child() can automate the smaller sections. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/GoldbergData/status/1334241946815004673))
* @mapaulacaldas: @\_bcullen You can use the Ctlr + Alt + I to create new code chunks AND to break up big ones into two ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mapaulacaldas/status/1333904571618512898))
* @DagHjermann: @\_bcullen Ctrl + Shift + O for showing an overview of your script (shows headers and functions) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DagHjermann/status/1334150313134133251))
* @aggokittu: @\_bcullen @rstatstweet Turn sections into tabs with `.tabset` . So users can click on tab titles instead of scrolling. Provides easy organization of parallel content. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/aggokittu/status/1333913351945129987))
* @ericbonucci: @\_bcullen Drag and drop formulas from Wikipedia into your R Markdown report!
