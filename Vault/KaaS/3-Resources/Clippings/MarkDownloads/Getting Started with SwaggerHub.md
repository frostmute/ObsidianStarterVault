# Getting Started with SwaggerHub

*Source: [Getting Started | SmartBear Support | SmartBear Software](https://support.smartbear.com/swaggerhub/getting-started/)*

> ## Excerpt
> SwaggerHub is a collaborative platform for defining your APIs using the OpenAPI Specification, and managing them throughout their lifecycle. It integrates the core Swagger tools (UI, Editor, Codegen, and Validator) into a single platform to help you coordinate the entire workflow of an API’s lifecycle. To help get you started, we’ve put together a custom learning path, using just some of the free resources available to customers.



## Overview

SwaggerHub is a collaborative platform for defining your APIs using the [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/), and managing them throughout their lifecycle. It integrates the core Swagger tools (UI, Editor, Codegen, and Validator) into a single platform to help you coordinate the entire workflow of an API’s lifecycle. To help get you started, we’ve put together a custom learning path, using just some of the free resources available to customers.

We’ll start with some Getting Started topics which will cover initial setup, including installation and license activation. SwaggerHub is offered as both a SaaS subscription platform and as an On-premise / Cloud solution. These are covered in our Getting Started Information below. If you already have a SaaS subscription you can probably skip ahead, but we’ll show you how you can sign up as well as the on-premise deployment options.

From there we have broken the topics down into various levels of difficulty.

-   If you’re new to SwaggerHub or just looking for a quick refresher, we suggest you start with the Introductory Topics. This will include things like Creating a New API, User Permissions, and Collaboration.
-   The Intermediate Level topics will cover some more technical aspects of the tool, like the Repository, Versions, and SCM Integrations.
-   Our Advanced Topics discuss some useful advanced functionality. Topics in this section include Standardization and Governance, Shared code (Domains), and how to use SwaggerHub with your CI/CD pipeline.

Before you can create your first API, you must choose how you will access SwaggerHub. We offer two access options, listed below, and you can pick the one that will work best for you.

## SwaggerHub SaaS

Our SaaS platform is a subscription delivery model. You can begin using SwaggerHub almost immediately from the SmartBear public SaaS portal:

-   Navigate your web browser to: [https://app.swaggerhub.com/signup](https://app.swaggerhub.com/signup)
-   Enter your Account and Organization details
-   You are now Ready to Create and Import your APIs
-   Visit [Creating a SwaggerHub Account](https://app.swaggerhub.com/help/signup) page for a full walkthrough

## SwaggerHub On-premise

The on-premise deployment option is a self-hosted instance of SwaggerHub. SwaggerHub is not an installable product, we ship a carefully tested VM with a base operating system of Ubuntu LTS. You then configure and manage your instance from the On-premise Administration Console. More information including release notes can be found in our [SwaggerHub On-Premise Administrator Guide](https://app.swaggerhub.com/help/enterprise/index).

SwaggerHub On-premise can be purchased and deployed on the following platforms:

-   AWS
-   Azure
-   VMware
-   VirtualBox running on a bare-metal server (running on a VM is not supported)

Our [Installing SwaggerHub On-Premise](https://app.swaggerhub.com/help/enterprise/installation/index) guide includes complete details on getting your On-premise instance up and running, include [Initial Configuration](https://app.swaggerhub.com/help/enterprise/installation/initial-configuration).

If you are unsure of which option is the best fit, please contact our team at [sales@smartbear.com](mailto:sales@smartbear.com) for further details on purchase and licensing options.

That’s all there is to it! You’re now all set up to follow along with the rest of this guide.
