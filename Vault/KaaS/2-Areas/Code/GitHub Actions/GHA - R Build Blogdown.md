# GHA - R Build Blogdown

*Source: https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples#build-blogdown-site*

`usethis::use_github_action("blogdown")`

This example builds a [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) site for a repository and then deploys the book via [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It uses [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) to ensure the package versions remain consistent across builds. You will need to run `renv::snapshot()` locally and commit the `renv.lock` file before using this workflow, see [Using renv with Continous Integration](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/ci.html) for additional information. **Note** you need to add a `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` a `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` secret to your repository for the netlify deploy (see [Managing secrets](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples#managing-secrets) section for details).
