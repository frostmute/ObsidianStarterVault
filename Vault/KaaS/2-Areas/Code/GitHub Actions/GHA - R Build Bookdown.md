# GHA - R Build Bookdown

*Source: https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples#build-bookdown-site*

`usethis::use_github_action("bookdown")`

This example builds a [bookdown](https://bookdown.org) site for a repository and then deploys the site via [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It uses [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) to ensure the package versions remain consistent across builds. You will need to run `renv::snapshot()` locally and commit the `renv.lock` file before using this workflow, and after every time you add a new package to `DESCRIPTION`. See [Using renv with Continous Integration](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/ci.html) for additional information. **Note** you need to add a `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` and a `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` secret to your repository for the netlify deploy (see [Managing secrets](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples#managing-secrets) section for details).
