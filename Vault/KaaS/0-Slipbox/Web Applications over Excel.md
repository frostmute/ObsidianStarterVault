## Overview

Of all the software regularly used by businesses, Excel remains one of the most popular by far. Spreadsheets are essential tools for businesses to keep a whole host of their processes organized but, despite its benefits, there are many parts of Microsoft’s spreadsheet solution that are particularly inconvenient, and can even make life harder.

Web App development and software engineering offer a solution to the commonly-encountered issues enterprises find themselves having with [Excel](../2-Areas/Code/Excel/Excel.md), and removes the risk of spreadsheet chaos. Additionally, a developer can  leverage pre-existing excel models and continue to make use of the existing spreadsheets while eliminating the direct access that so often results in exposed IP, undesirable edits and version confusion. 

This note discusses the main reasons why businesses would be best served by web-based products over Excel solutions.
