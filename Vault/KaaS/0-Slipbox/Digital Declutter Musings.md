## Set Goals

````ad-tip

*Organizing digital files can take over your life if you let it, so start by getting specific about what you want to accomplish. That way, you’ll prevent the project from taking more time and resources than you want.*

````

Start by asking who, when, and how:

* **Who** needs to understand your digital file organization system? The obvious answer is “everyone,” but consider the needs of people who aren’t very tech-savvy and those who will only be accessing your files occasionally.
* **When** will you start this, and how much time can you spend?
* **How** will you know you’ve succeeded?

Here’s an example: 

 > 
 > "All 22 employees need to understand our new digital file organization, but especially the writers and graphic designers, since they create the files. The office manager will start by spending one Friday afternoon on this, followed by an hour or so each week. We’ll know if it worked if it’s faster and easier for project managers to find the latest files for client projects."

## Preparations

* What do they like and dislike about the current computer file organization system?
* What’s confusing or difficult to find?
* What are their suggestions for how to organize digital files? What’s worked well for them in the past?

Along with their input, here’s what else you need:

* **Tools:** Your computer and [online file-sharing software](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/file-sharing). It’s best to store files on a cloud-based server, rather than on-premises, because it’s easier for everyone to access.
* **Supplies:** Paper and pen for jotting down notes or reminders (optional).
* **Time:** At least two hours, unless you have very few files. You don’t have to do it all in one sitting, though—break it into chunks so it’s more manageable.

## Delete and Archive First

There’s definitely an argument for saving everything just in case, especially tax-related documents. But if you have duplicate files or documents you’ll never reference again, delete them. Delete files before you start filing so you don’t waste time organizing them, just to delete them later. If you’re not sure whether to keep them, put them in a folder titled *Archive*.
