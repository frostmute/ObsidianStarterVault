## Setup

Open a terminal and type this, replacing the email with **yours** (the same one you used to create your [GitHub](../3-Resources/Tools/Developer%20Tools/Version%20Control/GitHub.md) account). It will prompt for information. Just press enter until it asks for a **passphrase**:

````bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh && ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -o -a 100 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -C "TYPE_YOUR_EMAIL@HERE.com"
````

**NB:** when asked for a passphrase, put something you want (and that you'll remember), it's a password to protect your private key stored on your hard drive. You'll type, nothing will show up on the screen, **that's normal**. Just type the passphrase, and when you're done, press `Enter`.

Then you need to give your **public** key to GitHub. Run:

````bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
````

It will prompt on the screen the content of the `id_ed25519.pub` file. Copy that text, then go to [github.com/settings/ssh](https://github.com/settings/ssh). 

Click on **Add SSH key**, fill in the Title with your computer name, and paste the **Key**.

Finish by clicking on the **Add key** green button.

To check that this step is completed, in the terminal run this. You will be prompted a warning, type `yes` then `Enter`.

````bash
ssh -T git@github.com
````

If you see something like this, you're done!

````bash
# Hi --------! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access
````

If it does not work, try running this before trying again the `ssh -T` command:

````bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
````
