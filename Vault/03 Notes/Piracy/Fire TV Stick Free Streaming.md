# Torrentio

 Configuration

[](https://champagne.pages.dev/piracy-guides/firestick/#configuration)

We will use Torrentio as the addon to search for torrents and communicate with your debrid provider.

1. To avoid installing multiple copies, make sure to uninstall the plugin before modifying the configuration.
2. Use [this](https://torrentio.strem.fun/configure) to configure the addon to your preferences.
    - Disable options that your Firestick or TV does not support to prevent crashing when viewing the first result of each episode.

---

A debrid provider is not mandatory, but it is strongly advised. Without one, you may encounter difficulties and your IP address will be revealed.

A debrid service is a subscription that lets you download or stream torrents, similar to a seedbox. The essential distinction is that when you torrent to a debrid, the files are cached. This allows for immediate streaming if someone has already downloaded the torrent, rather than waiting for the download.
