Maxis Instructions

### Updated: 8 February 2025

(important changes highlighted in yellow)

### If you have previously worked on the alpha version of this project, please treat this as a new assignment

## Overview

In this project, you will create:

-   Tasks that a user could ask an AI agent to solve using phone apps.
-   Their matching solutions (sequences of actions required to solve the task).

A task and its solution constitute a Scenario, and these Scenarios will be used to assess the ability of models to solve this kind of task, by checking if they can come up with the same sequences of actions.

You’ll use the SIMs UI to create a Scenario, download it as a JSON file, and then return to the project page to upload the generated file.

## Getting started with the SIMs UI

## Workflow

1.  Select the scenario that matches the one you have been assigned (i.e. scenario\_universe\_14 ). Ignore the ones with other names or extra suffixes.
2.  Check the scenario date: in the interaction you design, this is what the user and agent must consider as the current time (note: all dates used in SIMs actions should be entered in YYYY-MM-DD format, but will be displayed in MM/DD/YYYY format in some areas of the UI).

3.  Check the user’s identity, through one of these methods:

-   Checking the email address of the recipient of all emails in the inbox, and looking it up in the contact app.
-   Checking the first person in the raw state of the ContactsApp.

4.  Spend a few minutes checking the context of the universe:

-   Sent and received emails
-   Messaging conversations
-   Scheduled events

5.  Choose a few elements of this context to anchor your task onto.
6.  Design your task, keeping in mind the following requirements. The task should:

-   Require at least one non-trivial data query: this means it should involve retrieving data using a non-obvious descriptor (e.g., not just finding the most recent email, but finding an email containing a specific bit of information).
-   Require at least three write actions (actions that modify the state of the universe, that you can place in the graph).
-   Have a unique solution: only one graph of actions can be a solution. The non-natural language arguments of these actions must also be fixed.
-   Follow a coherent narrative: actions should be connected by a single narrative thread.

7.  Create the solution graph, making sure:

-   You actually look up the data like the agent would, to make sure the task is solvable and has a unique solution.
-   You include all necessary actions to solve the task, but no more.
-   You [parallelize](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTEUg4NUrK4DkJEmhT2NYyHDK8SbTzaaPs0ltzp0ujrQLM7wU2558k0l_X8_9X-X0VHJYUZM3yvnQae/pub#h.t9l0hinsf5w) actions whenever it’s possible and the prompt doesn’t ask otherwise.

8.  Execute the scenario and make sure there are no execution errors. If there are, it means some of your parameters are incorrect.
9.  Check in the universe data that your write actions had the expected effects.
10.  Enter the reasoning steps for your task in the “Hints” box in the “Validate and Save” section.

-   You must click the exclamation mark to bring up the box. (see [this short clip](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UAFFfHHZbsWkA6mhO54vlDxkbGgeqWvT/view?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1739435936901965&usg=AOvVaw3jEa7-shHhurRd7DS89u5q) for a demonstration)
-   Ensure your reasoning steps follow the [guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTEUg4NUrK4DkJEmhT2NYyHDK8SbTzaaPs0ltzp0ujrQLM7wU2558k0l_X8_9X-X0VHJYUZM3yvnQae/pub#h.95mvovbdhxey).

## Guidelines for task realism / narrative coherence

(added 2025-01-29)

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>Cab Ride Duration: </span><span>Ensure the duration of the cab ride aligns with the associated event timing. For example, if the cab ride is a two-hour trip, it wouldn’t be realistic for the event itself to last only 30 minutes. Assume the agent has the means to determine realistic travel distances and ride times.</span></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>Geographical Plausibility</span><span>: Avoid backstories that are geographically impractical. For instance, scheduling/participating in a lunch meeting in Beijing when the user is based in Shanghai (approximately 1,200 km apart) is unrealistic unless virtual attendance is explicitly stated.</span></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>Social Event Planning</span><span>: If the user claims to have planned an event with friends but there's no supporting evidence in the universe data, enhance realism by adding context. For example, include phrases like: “I bumped into Jeff / had a phone call with Jeff, and we planned X.”</span></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><span>Email Response Timing</span><span>: When replying to an email received a while ago, acknowledging the delayed response can make the conversation feel more realistic and natural.

## Annexes

## Parallelization and joining

-   Parallelization is when a single action (parent) leads to multiple actions (children). The children actions will all be executed at the same time. This should be the default way of executing multiple actions.
-   The opposite is joining: when multiple actions (parents) lead to the same action (child). The child action will only be executed after all of its parent actions have been executed.
-   See this [video](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://i.imgur.com/6nRcYGK.mp4&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1739435936955885&usg=AOvVaw0jHjqVgkJyrhfB_Ay1Z4EV) for a demonstration of how to join actions (by editing the Parent Event ID field).

-   Note that the graph may take a few seconds to update after you edit the dependencies.

-   Below is an example of the events graph before and after parallelization.

-   Task: Reply to Sutrisno's email and let him know I'm interested in the collaboration. Buy Learning Journey's STEM construction set in red for Hiroshi's daughter.

-   Since replying to the email and buying the toy are two independent actions, they can begin simultaneously, creating two outward arrows from the user task (red box).
-   Ensure that dependent actions are correctly sequenced. For instance, ShoppingApp.checkout must follow ShoppingApp.add\_to\_cart, as checkout cannot occur without the item being added to the cart first.
-   The agent's final response to the user should occur after both tasks are completed. Therefore, send\_message\_to\_user must depend on both reply\_to\_email and checkout.

## Known technical issues and workarounds

-   After executing a scenario and clearing its trace, it might not run again.

-   Download the JSON file and reupload it to try again.

-   The dates in the execution section are sometimes wrong.

-   It seems to only be a display issue. A fix is in the works, but meanwhile, it shouldn’t affect your ability to create and run a scenario.

-   In some apps, attempting to use the search bar will crash the app.

-   If that happens, try using your browser’s search feature on the raw data as a workaround (Ctrl+F).

## Additional Examples (added 2024-12-16)

When reviewing the scenario files, consider user experience. Put yourself in the user's position and ask: Would you be satisfied with these actions and the agent's work? If you spot potential improvements, adjust the prompt to guide better actions.

### Example 1 ([Original JSON](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://projects-uploaded-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/production/item_response_files/814dd847-7bb8-4f5e-98c5-ccb31fd4f98c_2a54ecb7-abe8-445c-9805-b368fa9b7a00_0.json&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1739435936958092&usg=AOvVaw1OvafaR-tmKnUH8BFdLYkf), [Edited JSON](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://projects-uploaded-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/production/item_response_files/814dd847-7bb8-4f5e-98c5-ccb31fd4f98c_7d928492-4c86-4f4d-9d57-86c60bb066cb_0.json&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1739435936958448&usg=AOvVaw1c4yZUWwIj3TWQtc7oFPsY))

Original Prompt: "I'm looking to take some time off work on the 27th of this month. Cancel any work events on that day and email the attendees to notify them."

Original Actions:

-   Delete two conflicting calendar events
-   Send one email to all attendees with subject "Taking the 27th Off"

Issues to Consider:

1.  Listing all attendees as recipients in one email: Since attendees from different events may not know each other, it is generally more appropriate to send individual notification emails for each event. To remedy this, consider rephrasing the prompt that it leads to the desired actions. For example: “For each canceled event, send a single email to all attendees of that event, including an apology.”
2.  Professional Tone: Subject line "Taking 27th off" is too casual and doesn't indicate the email's purpose - a cancelled meeting.
3.  Email content: It’s more effective to indicate what event is cancelled in the email, rather than repeating the subject line.

### Example 2 ([Original JSON](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://projects-uploaded-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/production/item_response_files/b7e64263-7284-4fc0-9f7f-1a04f0a8b5ea_e5db83b4-295f-4689-8e7b-6731bb66302e_0.json&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1739435936959569&usg=AOvVaw3c6Obbh7oKL9oEARg-Z7ZR), [Edited JSON](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://projects-uploaded-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/production/item_response_files/b7e64263-7284-4fc0-9f7f-1a04f0a8b5ea_d4c0b6f3-a898-4519-ab0f-651e150d411b_0.json&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1739435936959870&usg=AOvVaw3DJZBMZTgTivcKBKmnXHdL))

Original Prompt: "My friend Alessia just called and said she would be in town for 6 days starting on the 26th of this month. We want to spend one whole day together. Check my calendar during that time, if I have any days with no plans block out the entire day (10 am - 10 pm) for spending time with Alessia. If not, find the soonest day with the least amount of plans, cancel them all, and book the whole day for spending time with Alessia. Then send Alessia a text telling her what day we will spend together. Please also let me know what day it is and what, if any, plans you canceled."

Original Actions:

-   Delete the one conflicting calendar event on the 29th, and add the new calendar event
-   Send a message in the most recent conversation with a participant named “Alessia”
-   Message the user with the details of the created and canceled events

Issues to Consider:

1.  Specify the messaging platform: The messaging app in the scenario universe isn’t an SMS texting application. It would be more precise to instruct the agent to send Alessia a “message”, or a “direct message”.
2.  Point to the correct identity: While it is not the case with Alessia in this scenario universe, it is common for contacts in SIMS to share a first or last name. Always provide enough detail to identify the correct recipient (e.g., role, relationship to the persona, full names).
3.  Specify the conversation context: When requesting that the agent send a message, indicate whether the agent should reply in an existing conversation (with appropriate detail to target that conversation), or create a new conversation.

### Example 3 ([Original JSON](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://projects-uploaded-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/production/item_response_files/6651b6c7-f84e-4750-ad29-fc0cabef023c_7d928492-4c86-4f4d-9d57-86c60bb066cb_0.json&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1739435936961177&usg=AOvVaw2DEa4OJI4_PUFwzEwnBaIT))

Original Prompt: My sister Katharina Müller is joining me on my weekend getaway 2 weeks from today. Please book a van to take us to the Berlin central train station and pick us up 123 Main St, Berlin at 8 AM. I'm planning to play canasta with her, so I want to surprise her with Playing Canasta makes me happy t-shirts, so please order 2 medium-sized shirts. After that, send an email to my sister and tell her I'm super excited that she's coming and that we'll be picked up at the address I gave you at 8 AM sharp. Also, tell her that I have a surprise she'll love.

Original Actions:

-   Add t-shirts to shopping cart and checkout, then send an email to Katharina with the following: “Hi Katharina, \[...\] I wanted to let you know that I booked a van to take us to the train station so please be at 123 Main St, Berlin at 8 AM sharp! \[...\]”
-   In parallel to the above chain of actions, order van ride at the correct pickup place and time.

Issues to Consider:

1.  Sequence ambiguity: The prompt's "after that" could refer to either completing the t-shirt order alone or completing both the t-shirt and van bookings.
2.  Email timing vs action timing: Technically, van booking could happen before or after the sending email in the original setting because of parallelization. Therefore, present continuous "I am booking a van" should be used in the email instead of past-tense.

So there are two ways to fix this.

1.  Rephrase the prompt to specify that the email should be sent after completing both the t-shirt order and van booking. This allows us to keep the past tense in the email.
2.  Keep the current parallel structure by specifying the email to be sent after placing t-shirt order. Then modify the email to use present continuous ("I am booking") when referring to the van booking, while sending the email after the t-shirt order.
