## How to Navigate the Platform

The platform is organized into three main sections that you can access from the top of the page:

![[foldermedia/Onboarding Guide/AD_4nXeClT2TnrdYAM2q5pwMcxewgOtEUco1EWG--wpQG_Qf5WCBYGrNf5DMcFSudBZMCHGSObXtZTqo3Ms5XpVErGRA1XGg0w_AM2h6q-CzA8SQA0T5oAtBZvwX511OKQCPQfAhpL2k4iq_uzG5S4M7YbCZUK0m.png]]

## Page Overview

-   “Work on projects” is where you’ll find all of the projects and tasks available for you to work on, and where you can report time.
-   “Transfer funds” is where you will find a summary of your earnings and a list of your recent task submissions.
-   “Inbox” is where you’ll find announcements and updates regarding projects.
-   Lastly, in the top-right corner of the page, you should see your name and a drop-down arrow. Here, you change your “Profile” details (described below), contact Support, view our Code of Conduct and FAQs, and log out of your account.

## “Work on projects”

This is the main page of the platform where you can find active projects to work on, take qualification tests to gain access to more projects, and report time for projects that are paid per hour.

### Projects

This is the main section where you can see all of the projects available to you to work on. Whenever a new project that you are qualified for gets launched it will automatically show up in this table. The name of the project usually gives you a general sense of the type of work you’ll be doing.

By default, you will receive an email at the address associated with your account whenever a new project becomes available to you (this can be disabled on the “Profile” page).

We encourage you to keep a close eye on the “Projects” board as things can change quickly, and since we cannot guarantee how long a project will be available on the platform we recommend you act quickly if you see something you are particularly interested in working on.

Pay

Projects on this platform can either be paid per task or per hour, which is indicated in the “Pay” column - per-task projects will show a flat dollar number, while hourly projects show a $/hr rate. For example, in the image below the “Fluency Eval” project pays $0.48 for each task completed, while the “Chatbot Personalities: Entertainment+Productivity” project pays $25/hour. Per-task projects pay out automatically, but you will need to log your time for hourly projects (described under “Report Time” below). Please note that you are only allowed to work on one hourly project at a time - you may not have multiple tasks open at the same time.

Available Tasks

Each project will also specify a number of tasks available for you to complete. Note that projects are available to many annotators at the same time, so the number of available tasks may decrease as others work on the project. Alternatively, task counts can increase if tasks get added to a project, or a very similar project may get launched with a fresh batch of tasks.

![[foldermedia/Onboarding Guide/AD_4nXchnIuUnklEhzKMmtatl1BX7uGnvNZ45M1x-3_oNZEhsVlm8mBuW2NZHGTXcLXB58jO2j5SMhkDOCL3UlB83qTXGVsy8JuK0uSkWXlWL0cHmeur8SmGexAH8VDs1mKLypg7LtCIgiNl2uf3esnpTlvUNmjF.png]]

### Qualifications

Qualifications are used to assess your fit for full-scope projects on the platform. They are usually miniature versions (~5-10 tasks) of the full project they are testing for. If you perform well on the qualification and demonstrate a strong understanding of the task you will be approved to work on the full project, which often gives you access to work on hundreds or thousands of tasks. Please complete all the qualification tasks that are available to you if you would like to become qualified for a larger project.

### Report Time

After you submit a task in an hourly project, an entry for that project will appear in the “Report Time” section. To report your time, click on the appropriate project, enter the number of minutes you worked on the project, and click submit. If you work on the same project again, you will use the same link as before to report additional time. The approval period for the reported time is one week.

Note that projects will only be available in the “Report Time” section for 1 day (24 hours) after your latest completed task. If you have not worked on any hourly projects in the past 24 hours, this section may not be visible on your page.

![](Onboarding%20Guide/AD_4nXe7RwJyh_MKSegooeoEX-sODXzOLOJvbzWR1bOk9KMgRoOjNV6V3CR_I-lYdR7zDqKhY-N9GQKYunTI9rpOk_3BzMTdD8fT9FsM2klV4NMGYK8cnRjVraGc_pXx_n00mjpO09wKY4QU8Koa3UgKk0meiMdj.png)

The image below is the screen that appears after you click on a project and where you enter your time worked.

## “Transfer Funds”

### Summary

At the top of the page, you will find a summary of your earnings.

-   Withdrawable Amount: funds in your account that are available for withdrawal to your PayPal account

-   We can only pay out via PayPal, so you must either provide your PayPal email (described below) or create an account if you do not have one already. It does not need to be the same email you use to log into DataAnnotation

-   We recommend logging into your PayPal account to make sure you know the right email before adding it to your DataAnnotation Profile page
-   DOUBLE (OR TRIPLE!) CHECK THAT YOU'VE ENTERED THE CORRECT PAYPAL EMAIL - we have no recourse to recover funds sent to the incorrect PayPal account!

-   Clicking on the blue text below the summary that says “Add your PayPal email address…” will take you to your Profile page (also reachable by clicking on your name in the top right corner), which has a space for your PayPal email near the bottom of page

-   Amount Pending Approval: funds you have earned that have not yet passed the approval period

-   3-day approval period for per-task projects; payment will be approved 72 hours after you complete the task
-   7-day approval period for hourly projects; payment will be approved 168 hours after you report your time

-   Total Lifetime Earnings: this the total amount you’ve earned on the platform since you started

-   Includes “Withdrawable Amount,” “Amount Pending Approval,” and funds previously withdrawn

### Funds History

This section lists any date that you submitted a task (either individually-paid or for an hourly project) or a time entry. You can expand the date and project’s name to see all of your task submissions and time entries. Clicking “Show paid” will reveal any tasks/time entries for which funds have already been transferred to PayPal.

![](Onboarding%20Guide/AD_4nXfAIeWDGbu6vXHNktXeURLCD3SBd9EgkVCAwNcFKbRmx0pXFmBX16ED-rxQFSU0aIkDW-JiszTM_eDjQ4dME1VuRkqGxVNHugpjEXSHXQe6u7q7cIWzrqA4JC8YCy0E7zKv5GZTaeGYMh-bogZcxuzSTWLv.png)

### Daily Reported Projects & Bonuses

This section shows a breakdown of the hourly work entries you have submitted, along with their statuses. There are three possible statuses:

-   Pending Approval: the task or time entry is still within the approval period
-   Transferrable: the task/time entry has been approved and is available in your “Withdrawable Amount” balance
-   Paid: this payment has been approved and paid out to your PayPal account upon your request

![](Onboarding%20Guide/AD_4nXdcUuHw5BPpYIWPh1y2BqPP3e35u-oEOujqEhQeCEYIfh1kNoXQBmF2vG2VieNVOI7VpWEwfqAutwO_xm0gZ19t5_cS_d-0_8Hb6cNceQUgh5oWMiNrYrJOLAOrr97yjWInlcQzgJ8qNvsR4WAHxklc1E0.png)

## “Inbox”

The Inbox is one of the main ways the DataAnnotation will communicate with you about opportunities on the platform. If you see a number in parentheses next to the word “Inbox”, it shows how many unread messages you have (note the 4 unread messages in the screenshot below). If you don’t see a number, then you have no unread messages.

When you click on “Inbox,” you will see two main sections:

-   Feedback and Announcements: this is where you will receive general announcements and updates about new or active projects or bonus opportunities. These are typically messages that go out to large groups of annotators.
-   Direct Messages: this is where you will receive direct communication from the DataAnnotation admin team. This is often used to communicate personalized project- or task-specific feedback. Also, if you message the Admin team directly their responses will appear in this section.

You will receive an email notification whenever you have a new message in your DataAnnotation Inbox (you can change this setting on “Profile” page” if you click on your name in the upper righthand corner).

![](Onboarding%20Guide/AD_4nXf8xiD2qPhvOd33wmRpIwov6VD-t2I8oNfeLosnxpkl_WMGrXElBm1vZbMUAtKmo8uQmYmlZsCDYF9S7hggkC3xDa3AMOETrhMlxO4HD9ZRdgs7_LWd8DzPhiOQPwDsdijDEXddyLcZ1tJL4FRvLEFe8JQ.png)

When you click on a message in the left-most section it will open up the thread in the middle pane of the page. From there, click on the specific message or the link inside the message to read the full details (demonstrated below).

![](Onboarding%20Guide/AD_4nXcHi-3WZ26EGHr2-1NXVnpt9QsiG-AaIqABS4jKr7kg2XyEYadLNX4wcUrZHJgi6BA9qJYozn-K2kWpNLIEB9QFhT6YMKXZxwVEQg_JpVPVTCZpVdUCxkpdtR4YSJA1PnGFHEGdEY33tH1v35vJUhaYdPw.gif)

## “Profile”

Your “Profile” page is a place where you can access, add, or update your personal information, including languages you can speak, your worker account details, and your payment information. You can also identify some of your skills and expertise, as well as update various information associated with your account.

1.  Languages: If you can speak multiple languages, you can use this section to indicate your fluency and add new languages to your account. This may give you access to more work, as we run projects in many different languages. Please refer to our fluency scale when selecting from the “How well do you speak this language?” dropdown.
2.  Skills: In this section, you can add additional details about yourself that will help us understand the projects for which you are the best fit, including your educational background, hobbies, and professional experience.
3.  Personal Information: Your worker ID is auto-generated, and can be used to reference your account when communicating with admins or Support. Your referral code can be given to others and entered into their Starter Assessment after signing up. Your email address can be changed at any time.
4.  Email Notifications Enabled?: Uncheck this box if you would not like to receive email notifications from DataAnnotation (not recommended)
5.  PayPal Email: This is where you specify which account you would like your earnings sent to when you request a payout.

1.  You will need to use the same email address that you log into PayPal with, and it should be formatted as “[email@example.com](mailto:email@example.com)”, not a PayPal.me URL.
2.  Double check that you have entered the correct PayPal email address, as you will not be able to change it once entered.

6.  Delete My Account: Click this link to delete your account. You will be asked to re-enter your email on the next screen to confirm the deletion.

![](Onboarding%20Guide/AD_4nXe5Fhnoh1VnQw9Z2jnoguZ3b5Pywy5exAWg1orP_bhsLAQ0YcF5tpqoTrKlHZkInkcZQQrYM5taP_fHWg9CRwsQ620srAvKRNleFMV5tQ1huNAGrVfuv0LQq8RUdpQRuwqZioCvP9xRWM1Z1E-qlKXJU9M.png)

## Project Workflow

Now that we’ve gone through the structure of our site, let’s dive into what your interface will look like while working on projects!

## Interface

1.  A blue “Submit” button will appear in the bottom left hand corner - click this button when you have completed a task and are ready to progress to the next.
2.  In the bottom right corner you may also see a timer. The task will expire when the time runs out, so be sure to complete the task within the allotted time.

1.  Please note that this timer is ONLY to let you know when the task that you’re currently on will expire from your possession and go back into the pool of work so that someone else can work on it. That means that you should finish and submit the work before the timer expires.
2.  The timer is NOT intended for timekeeping. You will need to manually keep track of how long you spend working on hourly-paid projects. Many workers use an app on their phone or browser (such as Clockify) for this purpose.

3.  The white box in the upper right hand corner (blurred in the image below) shows the amount of money you have earned since your last withdrawal including funds that are available for withdrawal and funds that are still pending approval

1.  For per-task projects, this number will increase incrementally with each task you complete
2.  For hourly projects, your pay will not be reflected in this field until you have reported your time

Note: on some projects, there will be an “Enter Work Mode” button. You’ll have to press this first before being able to interact and make selections on the task. If you don’t see that button, you can ignore that process — the task is ready to be worked on immediately.

![](Onboarding%20Guide/AD_4nXeS84D_JL3M-_f0QM6qadD8vyNhp6U8n6MZ60aXq_QEhMhnirC6bI5iSzFAJVxfkuRkaBk3oGZORla_LFfeD5Be57qoijFTAe1qUyJMhHiIu9d8-n4rx_A9NITJYJPYItyKHr3RoRaNv6co7iNWat6nOKiA.png)

## Project Structure

The structure of this qualification task represents the typical structure of our projects fairly well, which is loosely as follows:

-   Project Overview / Instructions: the first text box typically provides a general overview and outlines the objective of the project. Some projects will provide all task-specific instructions here, while others will link to external documentation (as this example does). Links to examples are also often included here. It’s also not uncommon for this box to contain important callouts, clarifications, or rules of thumb about a project for easy reference.
-   Next, you will often see the specific piece of data that we are asking you to evaluate in the particular task. The objective of this project happens to be comparing the quality of two possible model responses and indicating which of the two is better, and the provided query is “Write me a very quick biography of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart”. You’ll also notice some clarifying details about the necessary browser settings for completing the task. Additionally, we often provide you with assistance to help expedite each task—here, for example, hyperlinks to Reddit and Google searches are embedded into the task so that you can quickly execute a search if you are unsure how to categorize an entry.
-   Then, it’s time for you to complete the task by selecting a multiple choice option. When you are making your main selection for a project like this, we generally make the field a required answer, just so you do not accidentally submit a task blank by mistake.
-   Below this is a field for Optional Comments about the task or project. Like the heading suggests, writing content here is optional, but we encourage annotators to use this field to flag tasks that are especially borderline or unusual/ambiguous in some way.

Generally speaking, most tasks/projects will follow a loose variation of this flow (Instructions — Piece of Data to Evaluate — Your Answer — Optional Comments — Submit). Depending on the complexity of a project, working on tasks may involve work besides selecting a multiple choice option or typing in an answer. For example, several of our projects employ a tagging tool in which you need to highlight particular portions of a body of text, and so on. Regardless of the project, we do our best to make the process as clear as possible. However, we understand that things may still be confusing, so please feel free to ask questions in the chat function (explained below) liberally.

Upon submitting a task, you will automatically be directed to the next task in the project, and this will continue until there are no more tasks available for you to work on in the project. Whenever you are done working for a period of time or would like to take a break from a project, please click the “Exit Work Mode” button to pause your work (more information about this is available later on).

## Project Chat Function

The chat function can be found below the task and “Submit” button. If no messages have been seen then “No messages yet” will be displayed in blue text. Clicking this text will open up a chat box where you can message the project admins and other annotators working on the project.

![](Onboarding%20Guide/AD_4nXcQOKcaaBnetvpV8R2FUzGvIwqPqnTyYPQOAdAsiFtDbBWFp2t2Y9iniqcdWitPdx2v-tM_TLn8Uc-GFyL1JemvcEIMK2CgmnNvHoX-u19FYq9ZGrowOmT5QwFTKQoPJZ6udcjud_z3qPWjqrLSeMBDh5o.gif)

Here’s an example of a project chat. As you can see, the project admins are available to answer any questions you may have while working on a project.

![](Onboarding%20Guide/AD_4nXceeIHdgNQqpb6Qi0ubwV3iqVWMZzV3-QI1R-cWcbFukw-VXUo02qxeuaYve9y9tEtccFJ04MVv1KMXh6Kg5tVIS0IIgzjKUHaRKymbyt8pFGu-N1rTjbxeqYfLziEmazwNIaUm70TDAWUcTHDA1rWGWC0Q.png)

As the instructions atop the chat indicate, the main purpose of this chat is to ask members of the Admin team questions about edge cases in the data. If you run into task-specific issues, feel free to ask them in the chat. If you have other general questions or technical difficulties on the platform, please submit a Support request instead (via the dropdown menu in the top right corner of the platform).

For simple inquiries, you are welcome to answer each others’ questions—for example, if a fellow worker asks a simple question about an edge case that is addressed in the instructions—and we encourage you to offer insights to one another about strategies you use or any other input that might be useful.

There is no automatic notification system associated with the in-project chat function, so we recommend checking back in on the chat periodically for any updates or clarifications that might get communicated there.

## “Skip” and “Exit Work Mode”

Beneath the chat area you will find the “Skip” and “Exit Work Mode” buttons. The “Skip” button is helpful if you come across a task that is broken or that you don’t fully understand or want to answer.

When you are done working, please click the “Exit Work Mode” button to pause your session. This frees up the task for other annotators to work on. (Just realize that you need to submit work if you’ve done work on the task - Exiting Work Mode will clear what you have entered, if you have anything entered.

![](Onboarding%20Guide/AD_4nXd9ZV2u9l3H19Xoie7yVE-fcC_AKlmCXapE_Bs4tPX7ycJ8Y2012iWiceCNCtdTlRIFzD88l4YmYAXvaOLY6sDD78uB9QDaN7jKkKc9AefwfkmvEbdX3W03NhQWg5VmUyZ5uNMgSfrFdjDPmu4LuylUCe6s.png)

## Project Instruction Updates

Projects can change and evolve over time, and when such changes occur the project instructions will be updated. It’s important to keep an eye out for these updates so that you continue to work on the task correctly. The updates are usually highlighted, with the latest at the top. The updates are also typically dated, so there’s less confusion. You may also receive project updates as messages in your inbox (and email if you have notifications enabled).

In some cases, the updates will be made directly in the project interface. These will typically include guidance for commonly reported issues, answers to frequently asked questions, and specific areas of emphasis for the project moving forward. Please be diligent in reviewing these updates and make sure you understand them before moving forward.

In other instances, external documentation may get updated (shown below), or additional external links may get added. Please be sure to review any document updates before continuing to work on a project. ![](Onboarding%20Guide/AD_4nXeks1I0P6RDLzqNzUG6RG7zgqdnstnUqToEI9sGDIeq-pAnZcGaVb26Nipy6k9NgNGhYOHtkNhIbbUMNVfY68SqLXAnyg8-k46Q0yAEWB3rA55Q5J215txDhruxMFdNZKREmnNNqBF_kVyQ3Bwh5tVLLLY.png)

## Bonuses

Occasionally, projects may be eligible for bonuses based on workload targets. As in the example below, the title of a project typically indicates when a bonus is available.

When you open up this bonus notification task, the instructions will explain how you can earn the bonus. Bonus instructions typically include the following details:

-   The project(s) that are eligible for bonus
-   How many hours you must work or tasks you must complete to earn the bonus
-   How much bonus pays out
-   How long the bonus is available
-   The number of times you can earn the bonus
-   Notes or special instructions you must follow to earn the bonus

Please read the bonus instructions carefully - it is important you follow the prescribed process for your work to qualify.

## Tips

## Getting Access to More Projects

Doing [Qualifications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSp3jh-pfbdIPfUpjDj2D7LZs9hYyF4OF2_BLUYsO_RZ3YXgPPUWpMXBLXeLgb2OclBdmFQ96dKbp4I/pub#id.g2oi9hlt6b2k) is the best (and sometimes only) way to gain access to new projects and more work. If you are able to complete them soon after they are posted, you may have a better chance of working on the project before the available tasks have been completed. Of course, the more projects you have access to, the busier you can be!

In general, a good rule of thumb for gaining access to additional projects and qualifications is to work on the projects you currently have! Once you show that you are a reliable worker, you may see more and more projects available to you.

Having email notifications enabled is a very helpful feature to ensure that you see new projects as soon as they become available.

## What Projects Should I Work On?

It may be hard to decide on which projects to work on and how to spend your time. One method is to focus your work towards projects with a priority indication as shown below.

![](Onboarding%20Guide/AD_4nXc-qnMuE61Z2AkZV9dOUnyXTlAIRNSBWQgSiyHJJk5TuWIRSEhAw5VZc1_jAehEJI6uL2JpWGh88nbCAOt42R9gUr5cBa2yytsJUQtvI7Ypa3-SlJ2UdYDsKvPiZVXNNZUglhy-dSBonwiwwbp9xB4VcQhA.png)

Working on higher priority projects is very helpful, but don’t feel like you have to exclusively work on these. It can be mentally taxing to spend all of your time on a singular task, so taking a break to work on a different project is completely understandable.

Another way to decide is simply by working on the projects that you enjoy doing. As you work more, you may find that you have preferences for the type of work you do because you find it fun, interesting, challenging etc. Working in a sustainable way often means working on those projects that you like doing! As mentioned earlier, it can be advantageous to split your time between different projects so that you don’t get burnt out.

If you have access to projects with bonus goals, a great way to maximize your earnings is to meet those goals. You will find that your hourly rate increases significantly if you take the bonus payment into account.

### Examples of Workflows

An example of someone structuring their workday may look like the following:

1.  Determine how many hours they have available. Let’s say they have 3 hours for this example.
2.  Looking through their projects page, they see a new Qualification, a few hourly paid projects and a few per-task paid projects.
3.  They are very familiar with one of the per-task paid projects and know the tasks typically get completed very quickly. They do these first so that they get a chance to work on them. They end up spending 30 minutes on these tasks before they run out.
4.  Now, they’ll complete the Qualification tasks. This also takes them 30 minutes.
5.  They now have 2 hours left, so they dedicate their remaining time to the hourly paid project. (Note that they only work on one hourly project at a time!)

This is a good example of someone organizing their workflow to take advantage of the time they have available to gain access to new projects, diversifying their work, as well as optimizing their wages.

Here’s another example:

1.  Determine how many hours they have available. This person has more time, with 5 hours available.
2.  They also see a Qualification project, a per-task paid project (one they really enjoy, but doesn’t pay as well) and a few hourly paid projects.
3.  They have been working towards a bonus goal for an hourly paid project, so they start out by putting an hour of work towards that (again, only working on one hourly project at a time)
4.  Now, they go ahead and complete the Qualification tasks. This takes them 30 minutes.
5.  They go back to their hourly paid project and spend 2 hours working.
6.  A mental break from the hourly paid project feels welcome and they see the per-task paid project is still available. They work on these for 30 minutes.
7.  They finish out their day working on the hourly paid project and meet their time required for the bonus goal!

This example shows how you can keep the priority of increasing your wages, but also make a longer work session feel sustainable.
