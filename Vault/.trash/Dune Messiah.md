description: "Dune messiah - 'A holy war fought in space and on a thousand planets had made Paul Atreides the religious and political leader of the galaxy. The product of generations of controlled breeding, trained in the arcane disciplines by the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, he had more than human powers, including the ability to sense the shape of the future. Then the Bene Gesserit, unable to dominate the man they had made a god, set out to overthrow him. But Paul Atreides could foresee their plans and shape them to an unexpected and shocking goal...'--Dust jacket."
