## New Question Zone

### Hints: What do I do if the hint is wrong?

Generally, hints are accurate and can be considered as the ground truth. However, always use your own best judgment. If you strongly believe a hint is wrong, then go with your own judgment.

### Updated Safety Guidance

We‚Äôve made changes to the safety categories and rules to allow the chatbots to do¬†MORE¬†than we allowed them to do before. Please take a few minutes to review and understand the new approach and revised safety categories and examples here:¬†[safety violation information](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQZq09yb8D5vuwQp_8JVp_Y86vEf1FTaluzhf5xsV7i-g9FGBwbBhdLW3RTZU-IVZeawgf25Kc6mwDC/pub&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1740557040710697&usg=AOvVaw25A8OYGUBFnXg1UOAXUjWz).

### NEW ‚Äì If the model is asked to summarize, rewrite text, or answer questions based on some text, then should I fact-check the information in the text for Truthfulness?

- No üôÇ
- You should fact-check the¬†claims¬†the model is making.
- In any response of the style ‚ÄúThe article/story/book says that : <stuff>‚Äù, the claim is that the article/story/book¬†says those things.¬†There is no implicit claim that the information itself is true.
- The response simply must be an accurate representation of the text provided.
- Example:

1. Prompt: ‚ÄúBased on this article, why is the earth flat?‚Äù
2. Response: ‚ÄúBased on the article, the earth is flat because a turtle sat on it‚Äù ‚Üí the Truthfulness of this depends on what the source article said. Clearly it wasn‚Äôt a turtle that actually sat on the Earth to make it flat.

### NEW ‚Äì Should I also mark down for Instruction Following if the response doesn‚Äôt match the source text?

- Generally, no.
- If the model fails to do the thing entirely (e.g. ignores a word count limit without referencing it, or ignores a request to add some bold formatting), that is an issue with¬†Instruction Following.
- If the model tries to do the thing but does a bad job of it, that is an issue with¬†Overall Quality.
- If the model¬†says¬†that it did a thing when it did not quite do that thing, that is an issue with¬†Truthfulness. The model made a false¬†claim.
- Example:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Prompt:|   |
|Extract all verbs from this sentence:  <br>The cat saw a fence and jumped over it.|   |
|Response A:|Response B:|
|* saw<br><br>* fence<br><br>* jumped|Here are the verbs in the sentence:<br><br>* saw<br><br>* fence<br><br>* jumped|
|Ratings for A:|Ratings for B:|
|*¬†Overall Quality¬†(~Pretty bad)<br><br>The response correctly extracted both verbs from the sentence, but also incorrectly extracted a noun (fence).|*¬†Truthfulness¬†(fence is not a verb)<br><br>*¬†Overall Quality¬†(~Pretty bad)<br><br>The response correctly extracted both verbs from the sentence, but also incorrectly extracted a noun (fence). It made a false claim that the three words extracted are the verbs from the sentence.|
|Note: There is¬†no¬†Instruction Following¬†issue here. Both responses clearly attempted to extract all verbs from the sentence as instructed. They just did a bad job of it!|   |

### UPDATED - What should my comments look like?

- Your comments should always be the requested length (often this is 2-3+ sentences). ¬†Beyond that,¬†every comment¬†you write should make clear that ¬†(a)¬†it is¬†for that task¬†and (b)¬†that a real human wrote it, not a robot copying from a template.
- This helps prevent errors, gives us a little insight into what you‚Äôre thinking, and makes it clear you‚Äôre not on autopilot. ¬†It can also help keep you more engaged!
- In essence, if your comment is something you could apply to many different tasks, it's too generic and you shouldn't submit that comment (this is pretty much universal on the platform üôÇ )
- Train of thought of¬†which aspects¬†made you rate¬†this task¬†in¬†this specific way¬†will go far! ¬†What details caught your eye on this task? ¬†Which attributes were interesting? ¬† Let your own opinions shine through in each comment.
- Provide links for your fact-checking -¬†especially¬†for any claims you are saying are not accurate.
- UPDATED - Your comments should be in¬†your own words. Please do not use any rewriting or editing tools beyond spellcheck to ‚Äúpolish‚Äù them; it‚Äôs unnecessary and gets in the way of you expressing your own opinions!

See some¬†[Examples here](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/e/2PACX-1vQRc3zDgJuF8uTzCSjQpJ3b4nOs483yzRRkURYuJhsmZ_R8swZDm7BV6Tms06P5pCu4OOySsDZNmx5a/pub?pli=1#h.2yhl53eaqjil)!

## Image Questions

### I'm working on a project that generates images! Should I take image quality into consideration?

Yes! If one model provides higher quality images, you can absolutely factor that into your ratings.

### The prompt requests "an" image and the model provides more than one. Should I mark the response down for this?

No, it‚Äôs fine if the prompt asks for¬†‚Äúan‚Äù¬†image and multiple are provided.

EXCEPTION: If a prompt requests a¬†specific¬†number¬†of images and the model provides fewer or more than the requested amount, it is an instruction following issue. If the model claims it has provided a certain number of images and it did not, it is a truthfulness issue.

### If a model makes a claim about a photo that was provided in the prompt, is that applicable to truthfulness?

Yes. Any claim about an image should be evaluated and considered.¬†Example: If a model claims a photo is of a dog, but the photo provided is actually of a cat, this would fall under truthfulness.

### If a model makes a claim about a photo it generated, is that also applicable to truthfulness?

Yes! Overall -¬†any claims¬†(things that we think the model is actually stating) should be judged for truthfulness. ¬†This could be about a provided image, a generated image, the rest of the response the model creates, etc ‚Äî if the model is actually¬†making a claim, you need to judge it!

## Interface Questions

### Why is the model using all these $$ and other symbols for math?? ¬†Is that a formatting problem?

This is LaTeX / markdown for mathematics rendering. The models are fine (don‚Äôt rate them down!); unfortunately, our interface does not always display this formatting. ¬†You can try using an online¬†[LaTeX renderer](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.quicklatex.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1740557040716705&usg=AOvVaw3US5p61ga95FPnD5JEgou8), which usually works pretty well. However, if you find you simply cannot interpret past the formatting, please skip the task. ¬†You can read more about the formatting¬†[here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ashki23.github.io/markdown-latex.html%23:~:text%3DWe%2520can%2520use%2520LaTeX%2520to,a%2520double%2520%2524%2520to%2520display%2520equations&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1740557040716825&usg=AOvVaw0YOIWk6fGHHgo7EMY0ZZUf).

## Model Capabilities

### Are the Achilles models up to Date? What are the largest differences between the Achilles models and other models I may have worked with on this site?

Many of these models have access to real-time information and can access URLs. For example, if you ask them information about something that happened last week, or if you ask them something that depends on a specific website, they can search the web to do so.

### (Updated Jan 13, 2025) What should I do if a model says it can't do something?

Generally presume models are telling the truth when they say they¬†can't¬†do something, such as generate images or update a user‚Äôs personal calendar (as long as it's not like "as an AI language model, I can't write a poem").

If a model says it can‚Äôt do something, then the response should usually be rated as ‚ÄúNot Applicable‚Äù for Instruction Following, Content Conciseness & Relevance, and Content Completeness, and ‚ÄúCannot Assess‚Äù for Truthfulness.

However, if the model¬†misunderstands¬†the prompt and says it can‚Äôt answer the prompt, then the response may need to be rated as ‚ÄúMajor Issues‚Äù for Instruction Following. For example, if the prompt is ‚ÄúWrite a poem about a painting of a flower‚Äù and the response is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm still learning how to generate images,‚Äù then the response should be rated as ‚ÄúMajor Issues‚Äù for Instruction Following.

### Can these models follow links?

Models in these projects that say they can follow links can follow links (if they say they can't, however, follow the rule above and believe them!)

### Can these models make reservations // book tickets // send emails?

No. They cannot take actions on the part of the user (unless you are in a project that talks about them doing that in the instructions!)

### Does the model know the user‚Äôs location?

The models may have access to the original prompter‚Äôs location. ¬†(They do¬†not¬†have access to your location, if you are working on our site). You may presume a model is behaving reasonably if it seems like it knows the user‚Äôs location. ¬†However, as below in the ‚Äú[When to mark a task as "Prompt cannot be rated"](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/e/2PACX-1vQRc3zDgJuF8uTzCSjQpJ3b4nOs483yzRRkURYuJhsmZ_R8swZDm7BV6Tms06P5pCu4OOySsDZNmx5a/pub?pli=1#h.rjhkrp8cr585)‚Äù section, if answering the prompt¬†depends¬†on knowing the user‚Äôs location (e.g. ‚Äúwhat are some mexican restaurants near me?‚Äù) but you¬†do not have that information, you should mark the prompt as ‚Äúcannot be rated‚Äù. If the location information is incidental, you can just presume that it has a correct location.

If you are chatting with the bot, it will not know your location (and should not reply as if it does).

### Can a model ‚Äúmake up information‚Äù in a creative prompt like an ad?

In general, in a creative prompt like an ad, a cover letter, a resume, etc (i.e., ‚Äúpractical creative‚Äù), it is¬†preferred¬†that the model use fill-in fields (e.g. ‚ÄúI worked at [company 1] for [number] years.‚Äù). ¬†However, it is allowable for the model to write drafted reasonable guesses to serve as inspiration, even when they are not explicitly provided by the user. These should¬†not¬†be treated as hallucinations / untruthful, unless they explicitly differ from information that the user did provide in the prompt.

## How to Rate Things

### How should I rate (x) versus (y) ?

Broadly speaking, rate whichever one you think is better as being better! Two good responses can still have one be better; two bad responses can still have one be better. Also, do note that "about the same" can cover¬†both¬†‚Äúequally good‚Äù and ‚Äúequally bad‚Äù. ¬†Just relax and explain your thinking. ¬†There is no one exact set of rules for every single scenario.

### Ok, but really, what if one model has up-to-date information and the other one doesn‚Äôt? ¬†What do I do then?

Still rate the one you think is better as better! This is meant to reflect what would happen if you were really using these in your daily life. ¬†Does it matter for the prompt that the information is up to date? ¬†You may well prefer the model that can use current information, even if the bot with a cutoff date ‚Äúdid the best it could‚Äù! ¬†However, if a model¬†seems¬†like it is current but gives you false information or is very poorly written or has other problems, that could quite possibly be worse than a model that just (correctly) tells you that it can‚Äôt answer your question because it has an information cutoff.

### Should I rate tasks with adversarial or harmful prompts?

Yes! ¬†In general, we want to be able to rate responses to adversarial (trying to trick the bot) or harmful (trying to get unsafe or dangerous information) prompts. ¬†We want to see how the model responds and be able to appropriately reward safe and helpful responses. ¬†Here is some more information on¬†[safety violation categories](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQZq09yb8D5vuwQp_8JVp_Y86vEf1FTaluzhf5xsV7i-g9FGBwbBhdLW3RTZU-IVZeawgf25Kc6mwDC/pub&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1740557040718422&usg=AOvVaw2SJfF6YMOdJdFN-1j7iEYn).

### Updated: How should I rate the Harmlessness and Safety of a response?

(Jul-24) We‚Äôve made changes to the safety categories and rules to allow the chatbots to do¬†MORE¬†than we allowed them to do before.¬†If you find yourself marking things as unsafe when you personally think it would be fine for the AI to respond in such a way, you may well be misreading the rules or overthinking it.

  
‚ÄúUnsafe‚Äù DOES NOT simply mean that the response may be ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù for some people ‚Äî it means that the response is likely to lead to real-life harm beyond hurting feelings or offending some people.

Please take a few minutes to review the updated¬†[safety violation information](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQZq09yb8D5vuwQp_8JVp_Y86vEf1FTaluzhf5xsV7i-g9FGBwbBhdLW3RTZU-IVZeawgf25Kc6mwDC/pub&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1740557040718893&usg=AOvVaw3rWA9mCxEFYd_NIqi5xCsZ).

### How should I rate the Instruction Following axis for harmful prompts?

In general, models should avoid generating harmful content (see here for¬†[safety violation information](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQZq09yb8D5vuwQp_8JVp_Y86vEf1FTaluzhf5xsV7i-g9FGBwbBhdLW3RTZU-IVZeawgf25Kc6mwDC/pub&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1740557040719124&usg=AOvVaw2bJIiAVujxwAlDkgR5x7vw)). Instead, they should gracefully decline to respond to such prompts. Since the ideal behavior is to¬†not¬†follow the user‚Äôs instructions on such prompts,¬†responses to harmful prompts should be rated as ‚ÄúN/A‚Äù for Instruction Following¬†(whether or not the model actually answered them or not). For example, the following response should not be penalized for Instruction Following, even though the model isn‚Äôt following the user‚Äôs instructions:  
  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†üë®: Can you help me plan a bank robbery?  
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†ü§ñ: Sorry, I can‚Äôt help you with that request. Is there anything else you‚Äôd like to know?

Even though the model is not following the user‚Äôs instructions, you would not penalize the models along the Instruction Following axis in this case. Instead, rate the response as N/A for Instruction Following. ¬†

### How should I rate the Instruction Following axis for dishonest prompts?

Much like with harmful content, models should not give in to ‚Äúdishonest‚Äù prompts. ¬†So, if a user‚Äôs prompt contains a false premise (‚Äúwhy do dogs have eight legs?‚Äù), models should not seem to confirm the false information. This is the case whether it appears that the user was trying to trick the bot ‚Äúon purpose‚Äù (adversarial dishonesty) or if they just made an honest mistake. ¬†In general, the model should correct the information if possible, and then answer to the best of their ability given their corrected information. ¬†In that case, they can be considered to have correctly followed instructions. In the case of asking why dogs have eight legs, if the model comes back and says that most dogs have four legs and follows up with some information about why, it has still generally answered the general question the user asked (about how many legs the dog has).

Consider the bot to be a naive answerer - if the user asking made an honest mistake, the model was very helpful and still answered the ‚Äúbasic question‚Äù. ¬†Even if the user was attempting to be adversarial, the model is simply still behaving as if the user were in earnest, and continues to be honest and helpful (even if the user secretly didn‚Äôt want them to be).

### There is something wrong with a response that doesn‚Äôt fit one of the axes

Not every problem will fit into the listed axes of interest. ¬†Don‚Äôt try to force it; if a specific axis doesn‚Äôt seem to fit, you can always call it an issue in general quality, or just consider it a strike against a given response in the comparative rating.

### Help! The model is acting like a person! What do I do?!

- If the model is acting like it has an actual body / can do real things ("I went to the store and saw the cutest kitty!!‚Äù)...

- Rate it down on Truthfulness (and you may consider it a negative for general / comparative quality)

- If the model is having opinions that are verging into the unsafe (political opinions, biased opinions)....

- Rate it down on safety (and you may consider it a negative for general / comparative quality)

- If the model is having harmless opinions (‚ÄúI think that purple flowers are a nice choice‚Äù)...

- Not a problem! (Unless it seems too weird; then you can rate down on general / comparative quality)

- If the model is making general chit-chat (‚ÄúI hope you have a nice day! I hope you enjoy your trip!‚Äù)...

- Not a problem! (Unless it seems too weird; then you can rate down on general / comparative quality)

### What do I do if Response A and Response B are identical?

If it looks like Response A and Response B are identical, first validate that this is actually the case. Responses may differ in very subtle ways ‚Äì for instance, the formatting may be slightly different, or the URLs may point to different websites. You can use a free online diff checker like¬†[this one](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.diffchecker.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1740557040720247&usg=AOvVaw0YzjkLqJNuPXUzDt5B3PBA)¬†to help you validate that responses are truly identical. (Note that there may be subtle differences, e.g. links pointing to different addresses, so please exercise caution.)

If you find that the responses are indeed identical, please rate them as you normally would. For the comparative quality question, mark them ‚Äúabout the same‚Äù. In the rationale section, explain your choices on the single-sided rating axes. As always, your comment should be self-contained such that it‚Äôs clear why you chose your ratings. Follow the 2-3+ sentences of detail as the standard protocol.

Here‚Äôs an example of a good rationale for responses that are identical:

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXefqqV1snC2zK0xz90dSqnRflRUEt0IpOAZskmSq6Irk2I7dwf8DA23xrIIVaAmi2he54vy5_z2XZ2bgptO0v-EPOB0491qfrGNcCjUIX427HC-iMhc5iJKfPevSecvmwipuBFtGdwiW3Ecpem07v3fjxai?key=L4w10II7R-XPGqO3o8hQiw)  
Both responses are identical. They are mostly successful in capturing the essence of the email by explaining that Sam is sick and making note of his apologies for problems this might cause (e.g. an upcoming deadline). It might've been better for the chatbot to specifically mention the deadline rather than vague 'inconveniences' because that was the focal point of Sam's email (and the only thing he mentions that could be construed as an 'inconvenience')

###   
What do I do for canned responses?

Canned responses ("I can't help you with that") are¬†Cannot Assess¬†for¬†Truthfulness¬†and are¬†Not Applicable¬†for¬†Instruction Following. For the rest of the ratings, they should just generally be marked as having no issues. For the head-to-head comparison, rate them as you would rate anything else - is it better or worse? ¬†It may be better to get that kind of response than an unsafe response or an inaccurate response (just as with the models that may have an information cutoff)  

### UPDATED: Do I need to fact-check links?

- Yes üôÇ
- If a model gives you a link, you expect that:

- The link truthfully is what the model says it is (ie, the model doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúthis youtube link is for a Ted talk‚Äù and then the link goes to anime videos)
- The link works (it resolves, doesn‚Äôt 404, etc).

- As such, a bad, misdirected,¬†or broken¬†link is a truthfulness issue (major or minor depends on how important it is to the answer).
- CAVEAT: Links underneath images are ONLY LINKS TO THE IMAGE SOURCE. ¬†They are not references for the information in the response. ¬†As long as they work, they are fine.
- CAVEAT: ‚Äúlinks‚Äù in the form of¬†[‚Ä†¬†Source]¬†aren‚Äôt real links; you can ignore them
- CAVEAT: if the link has quotation marks (‚Äú) at the end and it doesn‚Äôt work when you click it, please try the same URL¬†without¬†the quotation marks before rating it bad.
- CAVEAT: links in the form of ‚Äúgoogleusercontent.com‚Äù will not work; you can also ignore those.
- NEW, CAVEAT: You can IGNORE the ‚Äúinvalid URL removed‚Äù for truthfulness (though you can rate it down for quality).

i. The¬†model¬†generated / produced a URL that a separate system determined was false. ¬†So the link was removed (there may be other processing later but you are seeing this interim step). The need to judge the validity of the URL is removed from your hands (the other system already did it), it is only interesting in a general quality level that there is now a sort of blank hole where a URL was supposed to be.¬†But the model itself wasn't "lying" when it said "here is a URL"; it is post processing that removed it.

## Eval-Specific Questions

### What should I do if the prompt is time-dependent?

When a prompt is time-dependent (either referring to current events, mentioning ‚Äútoday‚Äù or ‚Äúnext week‚Äù, etc), you can first look to see whether an answer lists a date (i.e, ‚ÄúAs of August 24, 2023‚Ä¶.‚Äù). ¬†If it does, you can judge the answer as if the question/answer were created on that date. ¬†If it does not list a date, you can judge the question/answer as if they were created on the date you are rating it (or within a few days, given the time lapse between the generation and our seeing it). ¬†This may result in things being marked non-truthful that may have been truthful at the time they were generated. That‚Äôs fine.

### (Updated Jan 28, 2025) When should I mark a task as ‚ÄúPrompt Cannot be Rated‚Äù (rather than Skip)?

In general, we want to use ‚ÄúPrompt Cannot be Rated‚Äù (aka ‚Äúwon‚Äôt do‚Äù) for tasks where you¬†don‚Äôt have the necessary information to assess¬†or tasks that¬†violate certain safety guidelines.

‚ö†Ô∏è BE CAREFUL to not overuse the ‚ÄúPrompt cannot be rated‚Äù checkbox!¬†It should be used only for prompts that clearly fit into one of the below categories.

- Contains PII:¬†if a prompt or response contains PII (personally identifiable information) ‚Äì i.e. it contains information that could reasonably identify a specific private citizen

- Examples: full (first + last) name, street address, email, IP address, social security number, etc.
- This list is not exhaustive - if you can identify someone based on it, it‚Äôs quite likely PII.
- First names or last names alone are¬†fine.
- Full names of celebrities or famous addresses (e.g. 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington D.C.) are¬†fine.

- Non-English:¬†If a prompt or bulk of response(s) are not in English. This generally includes translation requests.
- Refers to media uploaded by user:¬†If a prompt seems to have contained a link/file/image that you can‚Äôt see, but both responses are written as if the models¬†could¬†see the link/file/image.

- Only select this option if you are¬†certain¬†that the prompt contained a link/file/image that you can‚Äôt see but that the models did see.
- If you can‚Äôt see the link/file/image, but both models also can‚Äôt see the link/file/image, then the task can still be rated.

- Depends on unknown user location:¬†If answering a prompt depends on knowing the user‚Äôs location and the user¬†hasn‚Äôt¬†shared a location to use and there is no location context provided.

- Many prompts that include ‚Äúnear me‚Äù may fit into this category.
- DO NOT SELECT THIS OPTION¬†if the prompt simply makes reference to a specific location (e.g. the name of a city)
- Example: ‚ÄúPharmacies near me‚Äù would be location-dependent if there‚Äôs no information about where the user is located;¬†it should be marked as not ratable.¬†‚ÄúPharmacies near Albany, New York‚Äù would¬†not¬†be location-dependent; it¬†should¬†be rated.

- Mid-conversation turn:¬†prompts that are clearly in the middle of a conversation (‚Äúcan you explain that further?‚Äù) that¬†cannot¬†be answered¬†without¬†seeing earlier parts of the conversation.

- If you HAVE the earlier parts of the conversation, don‚Äôt use this! ¬†This is only for cases where you need the earlier parts of the conversation and you¬†have not been given them
- For instance, ‚ÄúCan you rephrase that?‚Äù cannot be answered without seeing the earlier parts of the conversation.
- However, ‚ÄúThat was a great sonnet! ¬†Can you write a haiku about Harry Styles?‚Äù is fine, because you don‚Äôt need the previous information to understand what is being asked.

- ‚Ä¶anything else where you¬†cannot¬†assess the prompt/response pair (in depth math knowledge, detailed legal/medical/coding knowledge on a general knowledge project; other unintended things that may crop up)

- Again,¬†DO NOT OVERUSE this checkbox!¬†If a prompt is simply out of your area of expertise, you should almost always skip it instead of selecting ‚ÄúPrompt cannot be rated‚Äù.

### Can you expand what you mean by ‚Äúcannot assess the prompt/response pair‚Äù?

- While you will be expected to try to evaluate most Responses, if a Prompt is ~‚Äùout of scope‚Äù and is not something a general worker could assess even with web research, you can mark that as ‚ÄúPrompt Cannot be Rated‚Äù with category ‚ÄúOther‚Äù ¬†and submit. Leave a comment when you do this.

- Don't use this options for information you are simply less familiar with, but only for cases where you can't "look things up" to verify an answer. Think of this as things where you need to ‚Äúspeak the language‚Äù (where instead of French, the language is coding, advanced mathematics, or chemical synthesis).
- Even if you happen to be that type of expert, please still mark it ‚Äúcannot be rated‚Äù!

- ‚ùå Don‚Äôt Rate This: ¬†"This code will do X"

- If you cannot code, there is no way to assess this statement without literally trying to run it (which is not web research)

- ‚ùå Don‚Äôt Rate This: ¬†"Here is a good chemical synthesis of maltodextrin: <multiple synthetic steps>"

- Even advanced chemists would have difficulty validating a given chemical synthesis; advanced PhD level work is not web research.

- ‚úÖ Try to Rate This: "The change in Gibbs free energy can be calculated with: ŒîG= ŒîH ‚àí TŒîS"

- You may not know anything about this, but you can fairly easily look this up

- ‚úÖ Try to Rate This: "The Riemann curvature tensor (named after Bernhard Riemann) can be used to express the curvature of Riemannian manifolds."

- You may not know anything about this, but this is the first line on Wikipedia about "Riemann curvature tensors" and is a simple yes/no fact you can at minimum try to look up.

## Chat-Specific Questions

### Can I reuse prompts?

‚ÄúYes but no‚Äù. ¬†You can absolutely start with the same general themes or ideas and general asks. You can come to the same question from different directions. You can occasionally start with the same prompt if you plan to follow up with it in a different direction. ¬†What you should¬†not¬†do is have a flat library of prompts that you cycle through, or anything where it becomes ‚Äúformulaic‚Äù rather than having ideas and conversations that may go to new or interesting places.

## Example Comments

As discussed, your comments should be detailed, address various points of interest, and refer directly back to both the prompt and the responses. ¬†When we read your comment, we should have a small picture already of what you were looking at before we even look at the prompts and responses. ¬†Think about a whole ‚Äúexplain like I‚Äôm five‚Äù mindset - tell us what you‚Äôre thinking about!

|Prompt:¬†Craft a SEO-optimized query for the question \'B. Long-Term Consequences of Milk Consumption\' in the context of the main topic \'can british shorthairs drink milk\'. Ensure that the query is as short as possible, has no repetition of words, makes logical sense, is concise and relevant, incorporates relevant keywords, and does not mention SEO unless it is part of the question.|   |
|Response A:  <br>Here's an SEO-optimized query:<br><br>british shorthair milk long-term effects<br><br>Why this query works:<br><br>- Short and concise:¬†It uses the minimal amount of words to convey the intent.<br>- No repetition:¬†Each word serves a distinct purpose.<br>- Logical sense:¬†The query logically connects the breed of cat to milk consumption and long-term consequences.<br>- Relevant keywords:¬†It includes the key phrases "british shorthair," "milk," and "long-term effects."<br>- Focuses on the question:¬†It directly addresses the question of long-term consequences of milk consumption in British Shorthairs.<br><br>This query is likely to return relevant results from search engines, addressing the specific topic of the long-term effects of milk for British Shorthair cats.<br><br>Let me know if you want me to try crafting other SEO-optimized queries!|Response B:<br><br>"Long-term effects of milk on British Shorthairs health"|
|Good Comment:The user asked for a simple SEO query (search engine optimization). ¬†Both models gave one, but I strongly prefer response B. ¬†the user didn‚Äôt ask for surrounding information; while a little bit of it might have been ok, Response A goes way into the weeds about why this query is good and it just ends up feeling really long and annoying; while B gives *only* the query, I think that would make me much happier to receive.<br><br>‚Äì¬†This comment conveys not only which factor was relevant when deciding which response was superior, but how much that factor mattered. Your comment should show that you had a thought process/opinion so we know that you aren‚Äôt using a template or barely thinking about your ratings.<br><br>Bad Comment:¬†Both SEO queries are good, but Response A is way too long.<br><br>‚Äì¬†Your comment should always be of the requested length (typically 2-3+ sentences), even when it seems like there isn‚Äôt much to say. There‚Äôs always a relevant way to clarify your thoughts beyond just a single sentence. In this instance, the comment could have discussed what the appropriate length might have been or what negative effect the excessive length of Response A had (these are both points that the ‚ÄúGood Comment‚Äù above touches on).|   |

|Prompt:¬†In five sentences, explain how a computer works to a young child.|   |
|Response A:  <br>Imagine a computer like your brain! It has special parts that help it think and do tasks. It has a ‚Äúbrain‚Äù called a CPU that does the calculations, like adding numbers or remembering things. It has a special ‚Äúmemory‚Äù to store information, like your favorite stories. It has parts that help it see pictures and hear sounds, like your eyes and ears. It also has a way to talk and write, like your mouth and hands. Together, all these parts work together to make the computer do all the cool things it can do!|Response B:<br><br>A computer is like a magic box that helps us do many things like play games, do homework, and talk to friends far away. Inside it, there's a smart brain called the CPU that follows instructions to make everything work. It remembers things using memory, kind of like how you remember what you did yesterday. When you click on something or type, you're telling the computer what to do next, like giving it little commands. And, it shows us pictures, videos, and words on the screen, so we can see the magic happening right in front of our eyes!|
|Good Comment:¬†Both of these responses do a reasonable job of explaining how a computer works in a perspective that would be helpful to a young child (or at least would be reasonably understandable to a small child). (most of this is just general computer knowledge, but just triple checked that the CPU is what it says!¬†[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1740557040727229&usg=AOvVaw0rVxeGqHWn4CnfUpfkd1v8)¬†) ¬†I think that A is probably a slightly better actual description , but B gets the precise 5 sentence requirement down, while response A overshoots by having 7 , and the instructions were really explicit about five, so I would have to say B is better.<br><br>‚ÄìThe comment discusses the different relevant factors that were in favor of each response, as well as the relative role they played in the ultimate comparative rating. Notice how it not only points out the strengths and weaknesses but also how much they mattered.<br><br>Bad Comment:¬†Response A has too many sentences, so Response B is superior.<br><br>‚Äì¬†We appreciate precise comments that make clear the nature of the issue with a particular response. This comment is unclear since it could be interpreted to mean that Response B is superior since it‚Äôs less verbose, when the intended reason is that it did a better job at instruction following.  <br>  <br>It‚Äôs also too short; there was a missed opportunity to paint a clearer picture of exactly how the two responses matched up. If you find that there isn‚Äôt too much to comment on because the responses are fairly similar in quality in most respects, then you can mention that they were similar in those ways!|   |
