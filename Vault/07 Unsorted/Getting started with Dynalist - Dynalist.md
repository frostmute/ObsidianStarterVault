Hi there, thanks for using Dynalist! 👋

This document contains the essentials to get you started. Keep it as a reference, and you can also add your own notes on how to use Dynalist.

Check things off after you have tried them

Dynalist is all about nested lists

If you put your mouse on a list item, a hamburger menu icon and a 🔍 icon will show up

Convert lists to checklists by choosing "Add checkbox to children" in the item menu or Ctrl+Shift+C

You can sort list items by dragging their bullet points (works for multiple items too!)

You can select multiple items as well! Simply drag the mouse to select

Create a new document by clicking on the "+" icon in the header of the left sidebar

Right click on a document for a list of things you can do with it

Add a note to an item by pressing Shift+Enter

You can go back to the item using the same shortcut

Use the ! trigger to open the date picker and add dates

Make sure to type it after a space

(Optional) If you previously use WorkFlowy, you can import from WorkFlowy by choosing the option in the main menu in the top right corner
