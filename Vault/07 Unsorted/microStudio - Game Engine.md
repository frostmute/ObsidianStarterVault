## Online and integrated

microStudio includes all you need to write code, create sprites and maps for your 2D game.

All from your web browser. Your project is stored in the cloud, accessible from anywhere.

## Get into programming

Write your game code in microScript, a simple language inspired by Lua. The documentation is always there to help. Create cool demos in just a few lines of code.

microScript shines by its simplicity and interactivity. But you can also code in JavaScript, Python or Lua if you prefer.

## Design

Create pixel art sprites and maps with the included editors.

Using your sprites and maps from code is as easy as 1-2-3.

## Adjusting is a breeze

Change anything from your PC while testing your game on your mobile.

Your changes are immediately reflected in your ongoing playing session.
