Emoji, ASCII, and Text Meme Templates

```
```
  

I published this list of meme formats in 2019 for fellow social media marketers to easily reference and I still occasionally update it in 2024.

  

Enjoy!

- Emoji/ASCII templates are listed first, followed by text templates and prompts (starting around page 42)
    

  

- Symbols like (x) or ❤️ represent your subject, brand, or product within a setup/punchline. The examples can easily be altered or replaced
    

  

- Red text is additional template description/context, *not* part of the template
    

  

- Most formats only copy/paste correctly on mobile, not desktop, and may still require some tweaking when pasted.
    

  

- Use command (or Ctrl) + f to search for specific templates
    

  

- ASCII and emoji art can pose accessibility issues for people using screen readers, so experts recommend screenshotting your art to upload as an image
