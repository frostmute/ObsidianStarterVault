### Introduction

In this article, we continue our spiritual examination of the sacred geometry of the point and circle and how it applies to the human soul. This article expands on the following articles:

### The Vesica Piscis

> "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose." — Romans 8:28

The Vesica Piscis, an ancient symbol formed by the intersection of two circles of the same radius, where the centre of each circle lies on the circumference of the other, is rich in both geometric and spiritual significance. This symbol has been revered in various spiritual traditions, embodying profound meanings that intertwine with its geometric properties.

### Geometric Nature of the Vesica Piscis

*"The straight lines and angles of geometry symbolise the limitations of our physical world, while the curves and circles symbolise the infinite possibilities of the spiritual realm." —* [*Hasidic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasidic_Judaism) *teaching.*

In geometry, the Vesica Piscis is not just a visually appealing shape but a lens-shaped figure that embodies mathematical precision. It includes key proportions and ratios, like the square root of 3 and the ratio of the width to its height, which is the square root of 3 divided by 2. These precise ratios give the Vesica Piscis a sense of harmony and balance, fundamental in the study of sacred geometry.

We explored the deeper meanings of the Hasidic quote above in earlier articles, and when applied to the below vesica piscis, we have the symbolism of the product of two infinite realms. This is a metaphor for the universe, known in Hebrew as "Olam", whose etymology is from "hidden", the implication being that the universe is the place where God is "hidden". That is to say, the infinite God is hidden in the infinite universe, the two intersecting circles representing this idea.

#### Higher Dimensions

> "This most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being." — Isaac Newton

The above diagram illustrates the increasingly higher dimensional geometry found naturally within the Vesica Piscis. The simple unit movement of the point and circle from centre A to B creates the mathematics for the square root of one through to five.

The geometry of two overlapping infinite infinities gives rise to an unfolding five-dimensional cube. This is demonstrated by Riemann's mathematical extension of Pythagoras' theorum for higher-dimensional cubes. Thus, the equation for a cube of unit side length in five dimensions is:

For a 5-dimensional cube with each side of unit length, the diagonal *d* can be calculated using the formula:

![None](../03%20-%20MEDIA%20&%20FILES/9fabb8615651a27c4887949497efaef0_MD5.png)

where *l* is the length of each side of the cube. Since the edge length is 1 unit, this simplifies to:

So, the 'hypotenuse' length of a 5-dimensional cube with unit edge length is the square root of 5 units.

#### The Kabbalah Tree of Life

> "Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God." — Psalms 90:2

The Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism) Tree of Life, a spiritual model for how God creates and sustains the universe, uses a five-dimensional principle. One of Judaism's oldest texts, the Sefer Yetzirah (Book of Creation), describes its structure in great detail. One way to view the five dimensions of this Tree of Life is to describe them as:

Three axes of space (plus) One axis of time (plus) One axis of spirit

Thus, the human soul is said to inhabit the space and time of the universe created by God for evolution and purification of itself. The Vesica Piscis naturally generates the mathematics for this, in a highly abstract way, using the language of sacred geometry.

#### The Five Parts of the Soul

> "When he established the heavens, I was there; when he drew a circle on the face of the deep, when he made firm the skies above, when he established the fountains of the deep." — Proverbs 8:27–29

In addition to the five-dimensional concept of the Kabbalah Tree of Life, Jewish mysticism also describes the human soul as having five parts. Other religions, in particular Hinduism, also have a belief in a five-part structured human soul. The five-part structure is a natural consequence of the geometry of nature as described in these ways. We covered this in detail in an earlier articles:

The abstract geometry of the Vesica Piscis points to this natural five-part structure of the soul, which is further demonstrated by the addition of a third circle to form a trefoil shape, whose overlapping area forms a symbol known as a triquetra.

Primitive ancient swastikas also have a similar shape and are known as [triskelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triskelion).

Triskellion

This is important because, as Albrecht Durer demonstrated, it is possible to construct a regular pentagon from three intersecting circles of equal radius (see below):

Durer's geometric derivation of a regular pentagon.

In a later article, we will explore the spiritual principles of these three overlapping circles in greater detail.

### Spiritual Interpretations

> "The most beautiful and profound emotion we can experience is the sensation of the mystical. It is the sower of all true science." — Albert Einstein

#### Creation and Duality

The Vesica Piscis symbolises the meeting of two domains or realms, usually considered connected but at opposite ends of a spectrum. This can be interpreted as the physical and spiritual worlds, the divine and the mundane, or even the masculine and feminine principles.

The space where they intersect represents creation, where two distinct entities meet and merge to give birth to a new existence. This idea resonates with the concept of 'Yin and Yang' in Taoism, representing harmony between dual forces.

#### Passage and Transformation

The shape of the Vesica Piscis resembles a passage or gateway. In spiritual terms, this can symbolise a transition from one state of being to another, echoing the concept of spiritual transformation and rebirth. It can be seen as a metaphor for the journey of the soul, moving from one phase of existence to another or a passage from the earthly realm to the divine.

#### The Eye of Wisdom and Insight

The shape of the Vesica Piscis is also reminiscent of an eye. The eye is a powerful symbol of knowledge, wisdom, and divine oversight in various spiritual traditions. The Eye of Providence, or the All-Seeing Eye of God, is a prime example of this symbolism. The Vesica Piscis, therefore, can represent spiritual insight and enlightenment, the 'seeing' beyond the physical and into the deeper realms of existence.

#### The Union of Heaven and Earth

> "Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ." — 1 Corinthians 12:12

In Christian iconography, the Vesica Piscis often encloses Christ or the Virgin Mary, symbolising the intersection of the divine (heaven) and the human (earth). This echoes the Christian belief in Jesus as both fully divine and fully human, a perfect embodiment of the union between Heaven and Earth. In this context, the symbol is also known as the mandorla.

When represented in this symbolism, Jesus is usually surrounded by the symbols of the evangelists or authors of the gospels, Matthew (angel with a human face), Mark (lion), Luke (ox) and John (eagle). These symbols are also found in Ezekiel's vision of the faces of the Cherubim (Ezekiel 1).

#### Gothic Architecture

The geometry of the Vesica Piscis is most readily seen repeated over and over in the pointed arches of Gothic architecture and underpinned not just the structural engineering of Europe's mediaeval cathedrals but also their aesthetic and spiritual meaning.

#### Numerical and Cosmic Harmony

The dimensions and ratios within the Vesica Piscis reflect principles of cosmic harmony. This aligns with the Pythagorean philosophy, which held that numbers and their relationships were the essence of all things, including the spiritual realm. The geometry of the Vesica Piscis can be seen as a representation of these harmonic principles that underlie the universe.

### The Vesica Piscis in Other Religions

The Vesica Piscis is a symbol that transcends cultural and religious boundaries, appearing in various religious and spiritual traditions around the world. This is because of its creation by simple geometry and shows the use of sacred geometry as a universal spiritual model or tool throughout different cultures and civilisations. Its universal appeal lies in its simple yet profound geometry, embodying deep symbolic meanings.

#### Hinduism and Buddhism

> "O conqueror of wealth, there is no Truth superior to Me. Everything rests upon Me, as pearls are strung on a thread." — The Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 7, Verse 7

The Vesica Piscis appears in Eastern spiritual traditions. In Hinduism, it is associated with the creation myth of the cosmic egg, Brahmanda. The intersection of two circles represents the birth of the cosmos from the unmanifested Brahman.

> "Form is emptiness, emptiness is form." — The Heart Sutra (Buddhism)

In Buddhism, the Mandorla often surrounds images of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas, symbolising the merging of the physical and spiritual, the earthly and the nirvanic.

#### Paganism and Neopaganism

The symbol is significant in various pagan traditions, where it can represent the womb of the Earth Mother and the fertility of nature. In Neopaganism, particularly in Wicca, the Vesica Piscis is seen as a representation of the Goddess, the feminine principle of the universe, and is associated with the creative force of the cosmos.

#### Alchemy and Hermeticism

> "As above, so below; as below, so above." — The Kybalion

In alchemical and hermetic symbolism, the Vesica Piscis is sometimes used to represent the conjoining of opposites and the alchemical marriage, symbolising the union of the masculine and feminine, the earthly and the divine, to create the philosopher's stone or achieve spiritual wholeness.

#### Islamic Art

![None](../03%20-%20MEDIA%20&%20FILES/3dc8b6c6b266a45677a42256c0b87f4f_MD5.jpg)

Though not explicitly religious, the geometric principles of the Vesica Piscis are often found in Islamic art and architecture. The emphasis on geometric patterns in Islamic culture, reflecting the infinite nature of Allah, often employs the Vesica Piscis as part of complex interlacing tile work and intricate architectural designs.

### Conclusion

The Vesica Piscis is a powerful symbol that bridges geometry and spirituality. Its form encapsulates fundamental geometric truths while simultaneously reflecting deep spiritual concepts such as creation, duality, transformation, divine insight, and the harmonious union of different realms of existence. As a symbol, it serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of the physical and spiritual, the human and the divine, and the profound mysteries that these intersections hold.
