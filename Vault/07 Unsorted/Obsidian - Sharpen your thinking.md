It offers features like linking notes, visualizing relationships with a graph, and using Canvas for brainstorming. Obsidian provides options for secure syncing across devices and instant publishing of notes online. The platform encourages community engagement through Discord, a discussion forum, and developer resources for building plugins and themes.
