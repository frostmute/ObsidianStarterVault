I have hundreds of tagged bookmarks, some on my TODO list, and I wannt to import them all into Obsidian. However, I think I just want the bookmark **URL**, title, and **tags** for now, not a snapshot of the pages.

A whole file/note per bookmark seems rather excessive, since most of them would just be empty (I just need the URL, title, & tags), but putting all as a list in a single file might (1) create unnecessary links to the file and (2) make extracting the bookmarks into their own notes a bit of a hassle.

The issues seem very minor, but I'd like to better optimize my brain.

> I don't believe in one tool for everything. Obsidian is fantastic for writing, saving and linking notes and other markdown text files. That's what i us it for. My todos are in Todoist, my appointments are in Google calendar and my bookmarks are saved in raindrop.io
> 
> There are obsidian plugins for all of the services above. Some use iframes to show what's in that other service, others copy the data to a note of your choosing. Most of those plugins i dont use, i just go to the services website.
> 
> I do sync all of my raindrop bookmarks to obsidian, in a folder called resources. One file per bookmark, which includes all notes and highlights i made. Makes referencing them super easy within obsidian!
> 
> About tagging and linking: i made a template for the sync plugin to wrap the tags from raindrop in brackets. I use the breadcrumbs plugin to create a flexible hierarchy in my vault. Those raindrop tags become the parent of the bookmark-note (so an article about apples could be tagged "fruits" in raindrop, linking the synced note to a parent note \[\[fruits\]\] in obsidian)

> For links that I want to keep handy, I add them to notes like this:
> 
> Link::[https://Reddit.com/r/obsidian](https://reddit.com/r/obsidian)
> 
> Then I have a note that has a dataview section that lists all Link:: entries across all notes, sorted descending chronological order. Add that note to my main Canvas, and I can easily refer to recent links.
> 
> It would be awesome if dataview was able to query URLs natively, grabbing external links without needing the explicit Link:: notation.

> There is nothing wrong with having empty note files if it works with your workflow. I have a number of notes that I just want to be able to link to and see backlinks for, they don't have any content. As they're just text files and don't have any other storage baggage they take up almost no space unlike an empty Word document or similar.
