# Chapter 1: Foundation (Sam Altman)

## Why Should You Start a Startup?

- Reality isn’t so glamorous
    

- Stressful
    
- Always on call
    
- Hunched over tables
    
- Founder depression
    
- ![](../03%20-%20MEDIA%20&%20FILES/e83317e0027225284d4e77fb6a791dd4_MD5.png)
    
- Mark and friends @ FB
    

- You’ll be the boss?
    

- Everyone else is your boss
    
- CEOs report to everyone
    
- If you want power and authority, join the army
    

- Flexibility?
    

- You’ll be able to work any 24 hours a day you want!
    

- You’ll make more and have more impact?
    

- Joining as an employee at mid-early stage growing startup can be worth millions on its own
    
- As a founder, you need to be wildly successful for that to make sense
    
- Adding a late-stage feature to an established company is a force multiplier
    

- Employee #1500 at Google made Maps
    
- Employee #250 at FB made the like button
    

- The best reasons for starting a company are:
    

- You need to do it
    
- The world needs you to do it
    

- The world needs it
    
- The world needs you
    

- The world needs you somewhere - find where

## Core Principles

Success = Idea * Product * Team * Execution * Luck (where luck is any number between 0-10000)

### Idea

#### General Guidelines

- It’s become cool to not spend too much time here and just begin building
    
- A bad idea is still bad
    
- Pivots are fine, but most good companies start with a great idea, not a pivot
    
- Airbnb started because founder couldn’t pay rent
    
- If this works out, you’re going to be working on this for 10 years
    

- So think long and hard if this is something you want
    

- Plans themselves are worthless, but the act of planning is important
    
- You need a nice kernel to start with
    
- You need to build something that’s difficult to replicate
    
- IDEA FIRST, STARTUP SECOND
    
- Company should feel like an important mission
    

- Mission-oriented to get people to rally and be productive around it
    
- Hard ideas are easier to garner support for than a derivative easy one
    

- Your first idea does not need to sound and seem big/visionary
    

  

#### Market Size and Growth

- Must think about size, growth of the market, defensibility of the idea
    
- You CANNOT create a market that doesn’t exist
    
- Monopoly in a large market when you start is impossible
    

- Find monopoly in a small market and then quickly expand
    
- This is why some great ideas look terrible in the beginning
    
- “I know this sounds like a bad idea, but here’s why it’s a great one”
    

- You need a market size that will be big in 10 years
    

- Think about what your target market will look like in a decade AND what will cause it to plateau
    

- How do you tell which markets are growing fastest?
    

- Use instincts as a young student
    

#### Timing

- Why now? Why is this a good time to start this particular company?
    

- Why couldn’t it have been done 2 years ago, and why is 2 years in the future too late?
    

#### Customer Needs

- Best to build something you yourself need
    

- Building your first version for a customer who isn’t yourself is hard
    

- Idea should be easy to explain and understand
    

- If takes more than a sentence, it’s too complex
    

- Try to avoid derivative ideas like:
    

- X for red wine lovers
    
- Y for dog owners
    

- Begin with the audience - start with their demands, while you create the supply
    

### Product

#### Love

- When turning a great idea into a great product:
    

- Build something a small number of users love
    
- LOVE. Not like or want a medium amount.
    
- Talk to users
    
- Eat
    
- Sleep
    
- Exercise
    

- Law of conservation of love
    

- ![](../03%20-%20MEDIA%20&%20FILES/112bd10c42595565dc505e5081e3da15_MD5.png)
    

- A key indication of true love is spread by word of mouth (organic growth)
    
- Best way to achieve this is to start with something simple
    

- Even if your eventual plans are complex, begin with as little surface area as possible
    

- Fanatical commitment to the product helps building great products
    

#### Learning From Customers

- Recruit initial users by hand
    

- Anywhere in the world
    
- By any means possible
    
- Understand that group extremely well
    
- Do anything to make them love you
    

- Product building feedback loop
    

- Make this loop as tight as possible
    
- Show product to users
    
- What do they like?
    
- What would they pay for?  
    What would make them recommend it?
    
- Make product decisions
    

#### Metrics

- Focus on growth
    
- Company will build whatever the CEO decides to measure
    

- Active users
    
- Activity levels
    
- Retention
    
- Revenue
    
- Net promoter score
    

### Team

#### Co-founders

- No. 1 cause for death is co-founder blowups
    
- Most important decision as a startup
    
- Top 20 YC companies have more than 2 founders
    

- Best is tight group of friends with shared history
    
- Not good is solo founder
    
- Worst is random pairings
    

- A good model for a co-founder is James Bond
    

- Relentlessly resourceful
    
- Unflappable
    
- Creative
    
- Decisive
    

- When should co-founders decide on equity split?
    

- Lots of people put this off for way too long
    
- Should be done as early as possible
    
- If you don't want to give you cofounder even split, think about whether you want this person as a co-founder or not
    

- How to deal with co-founders leaving?
    

- Vesting
    

- n/4 of the promised equity where n is number of years worked
    

- Don’t work remotely with your co-founders
    

#### Hiring

- Try not to hire
    
- People tend to judge how real or cool your startup is by your team size
    

- It sucks to have lots of employees
    
- Low employee count is great
    

- Low burn rate
    
- Less management
    
- Lean, agile
    
- Clear direction
    

- The cost of getting an early hire wrong is VERY HIGH
    

- Bad hires can kill the company
    
- Airbnb took 5 months to hire their first employee
    

- Airbnb CEO came up list of key culture attributes early hires had to have
    
- He asked “if u were diagnosed with 1 year left to live, would you work at airbnb?”
    
- A bit crazy, but point was made
    

- Recruiting is HARD
    

- Great people have lots of great options
    
- Long process of convincing that your mission is most important
    

- That’s why product is most important
    
- People wanna join a rocket ship
    

- How much time to dedicate to hiring?
    

- Either 0% or 25%
    
- Biggest block of time spent, or not at all
    

- How to find the best?
    

- Personal referrals build the first 100 people
    
- It’s weird to call every great person you met, and ask your team to do the same, but these network effects are most important
    
- Look beyond your local community
    

- Does experience matter?
    

- It matters for some roles
    

- E.g., someone who runs a large dept or organisation
    

- For most early roles, not really
    

- Go for aptitude
    

- Things to look for in a hire
    

- Are they smart?
    
- Do they get things done?
    
- Do I want to spend lots of time with them?
    
- Do they have good communication skills?
    
- What projects have you worked on? (Take a deep, deep dive into this)
    
- Are they tolerant to risk?
    
- Are they maniacally determined?
    
- Animal test
    

- You need to be able to describe someone as an animal
    
- Ala they need to have a defining characteristic 
    

- Would you be comfortable reporting to this person if the roles were reversed?
    
- Try to work on a project together instead of an interview
    

- Employee equity
    

- Aim to give 10% to first 10 employees
    
- Be stingy with investors, generous with employees
    

- Employee retention
    

- Praise your team, give them credit
    
- Take responsibility for bad stuff
    
- Give them increasing responsibility
    
- Autonomy + purpose
    

- Fire fast
    

- You want to fire people who
    

- Create office politics
    
- Persistently negative
    

- How to keep existing employees feel secure?
    

- Usually fires are constantly making poor decisions
    
- Their bad performance is painfully obvious to all
    
-   
    

### Execution

#### Jobs of the CEO

- Set the vision
    
- Raise money
    
- Evangelise
    
- Hire and manage
    
- Make sure everyone executes
    

#### Focus

- What are you spending time and money on?
    
- What are 2 or 3 of the MOST important things?
    

- If you cannot distill and act on these things, you will not be effective
    

- Say no a lot
    
- Set clear overarching goals
    
- Communicate
    
- Maintain growth and momentum
    
- Don’t get distracted
    
- Work locally together
    
- Intensity
    

- Focus and dedication
    
- Relentless operating rhythm
    
- Obsession with quality
    
- Bias towards action, keep moving
    
- Do huge things in incremental pieces
    

#### Momentum and Growth

- Never take your foot off the gas pedal
    
- Keep accumulating wins
    
- Software
    

- Keep growing
    

- Hardware
    

- Don’t slip up on ship dates
    

- Save the grand vision speeches for when the company is winning
    

- When the company is losing momentum, focus on small wins
    
- FB in 2008 setup a growth team that focused on small wins
    

- Quickly became the most prestigious group in the company
    

- Sales fix everything
    
- Disagreement spawns when startups lose momentum
    

- The best way to dissolve disagreement is to ask users
    

- Don’t worry about competitors until they launch a better product
    

- The competitor to be feared is one who never bothers you at all, but goes on making her own business better all the time.
    

  

# Chapter 2: Before the Startup (Paul Graham)

- Paul’s full essay [here](http://www.paulgraham.com/before.html)
    

## Counterintuition

- Your instincts do not always work
    
- Startups are so weird that if you trust your instincts, you’ll make a lot of mistakes
    
- Listen intently, and do not ignore partners’ advice
    

- Counterintuitive ideas contradict intuitions
    
- Easy to dismiss advice as something that doesn’t make much sense
    
- Only advice that surprises you is worth listening to anyway
    

- Trust your instincts about people
    

- Don’t make the mistake of giving dodgy people a free pass just because this is the ‘business world’
    
- Pick partners like you pick friends
    
- Good, upstanding folks
    

## Expertise

- It’s not important to know a lot about startups
    
- It is most important to be an expert on your users
    
- Don’t feel bad about not knowing specific mechanics, e.g., fundraising
    
- One of the key mistakes of young founders is to go through the motions
    

- Plausible sounding idea
    
- Great valuation
    
- Cool office
    
- Absolutely fucked
    

- Never forget to make something people want
    

## Playing the Game

- Gaming the system stops working
    
- Mindlessly going through the motions is something you’ve been trained in your entire life
    

- Extracurricular activities
    
- Artificial standardised tests
    

- Young founders often want to know what ‘the trick’ is to winning at this new game
    
- The best formula is:
    

- Do well (lol)
    
- Grow fast
    
- Tell investors
    

- Gaming the system can work at big companies
    
- You can even fake your way through investors
    
- But with startups, you have to stop looking for ‘the trick’
    
- Different types of work allow for different levels of gaming the system
    
- How do you win in each type of work?
    
- What would you like to win by doing?
    

## All-consuming

- If you start a startup, it will take over your life to a degree you cannot imagine
    
- And if your startup succeeds, it will take over your life for a long time
    

- for several years at the very least, maybe for a decade, maybe for the rest of your working life
    
- Opportunity cost is very high
    

- Every big YC success says the same things:
    

- Running a company doesn't get easier
    
- Nature of the problems change, but volume of problems is the same
    

- Starting a startup is like having kids
    

- Once you push the button, your life changes irrevocably
    
- But people seem to think starting in college is the best thing to do
    
- Universities set up entrepreneurship programs left and right because it’s what attracts students
    

- Starting a startup is something you can only learn by doing it
    

- Startups take over you life
    
- You cannot be both a student and a startup founder
    
- You will be one or the other, or neither
    

- DO NOT START A STARTUP IN COLLEGE
    

- Starting a startup is just a part of a bigger question: how do I live a good life?
    
- Startups can be part of a good life for many people, but early 20s is not the time to do it
    
- Starting a startup is like a brutally fast depth-first search
    
- 20s should be an exploratory breadth-first search
    
- You sacrifice nothing if you forgo starting at 20, because you’re more likely to succeed if you wait
    
- The usual way for startups to succeed is because founders MAKE THEM succeed
    
- It’s stupid to do that at 20
    

## Trying

- Should you do it at any age?
    

- Startups are hard
    
- How can you tell if you’re up the challenge?
    
- SPOILER: you can’t.
    

- Paul probably has the most experience at trying to predict if people would be tough and ambitious enough
    

- How much can an expert know about this prediction?
    
- Not much.
    
- Therefore, he keeps an open mind about which startups would be stars
    

- The only way to know is to try
    

## Ideas

- So you want to start: what should you do in college?
    
- Get an idea and some co-founders
    

- M.O. for both is the same
    
- The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas
    
- Essay on this topic [here](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)
    

- All the top companies were not meant to be companies
    

- They were all just side projects
    

- How do you turn your mind into a startup idea machine?
    

- Learn a lot about things that matter
    

- Charles: first principles thinking helps here
    

- Work on problems that interest you
    
- With people you like and respect (this is how you get cofounders)
    

- Gratifying your interests energetically is the best way to prepare yourself for a startup, and probably the best way to live
    
- One good way to turn your mind into the type for good startup ideas is to get to the leading edge of a technology
    

- Aka “living in the future”
    
- At this point, you may not realise your ideas are startup ideas, but you know they ought to exist
    

- If you want to start a startup after college, learn powerful things
    
- Starting a startup is merely an ulterior motive for curiosity: just learn.
    

# Chapter 3: Building Product, Talking to Users (Adora Cheung, CEO of Homejoy)

- Have large blocks of uninterrupted time, rather than sporadic, spaced-out 
    
- Describe the problem your idea is solving
    

- Verify others have it
    

- What’s your solution?
    

- Become an expert in your space
    
- Identify your customer segment and focus on them
    
- Storyboard the ideal user experience before you even build
    

- Build a damn MVP
    
- Get first users to start trying it
    

- Parents
    
- Friends
    
- Family
    
- HN
    
- Local communities
    
- Reddit
    
- Mailing lists
    
- Influencers
    
- Blog
    
- Cold calls/emails
    

- Now you’ve got users and MVP, get feedback
    
- Iterate on product
    
- Ready to ship
    

- Just fucking launch it already
    

- Ready for a lot of users?
    

- Learn one channel at a time
    
- Iterate on channels that work
    
- Revisit failed channels
    
- Measure metrics, remain creative
    

- Types of growth
    

- Sticky
    

- Returning customers
    
- Good experience wins
    
- Customer lifetime value and retention are key
    
- Repeat (power) users buy more and more over time
    

- Viral
    

- 1 person tells 5 friends, network effects
    
- Great experience + great referral programs
    
- Customer touch points
    
- Program mechanics
    
- Referral conversion
    

- Paid
    

- Buy growth through ads and marketing
    
- Customer lifetime value > customer acquisition cost
    
- AKA cost to acquire a user is less than what the customer pays over the course of their subscription/time with you
    

# Chapter 4: Competition is for Losers (Peter Thiel)

## Capturing Value

- A business creates X dollars of value and captures Y% of X
    

- X and Y are independent values
    

- The US airline industry has more revenue than Google, but its profit margins are less
    

- As a result, Google’s market cap is far larger than the airline industry
    

- Two kinds of businesses in this world
    

- Perfectly competitive
    
- Monopoly
    

## Lies People Tell

- Monopolies pretend like they’re in competition
    

- We’re in a huge market
    
- Example: Google says we’re not a search engine company, we’re an ad company
    

- Global ad market is 500 bn, Google is only a fraction of that
    
- But in search engines, Google is > 70% dominance
    
- But they would never admit that they’re a monopoly
    

- Competitive companies tell everybody they have a special edge, and are not competing with other companies
    

- We’re in a narrow market
    
- Example: We’re the only British food in Palo Alto
    

- There’s british food in the next town
    
- Nobody exclusively eats British food
    

- The something of somewhere is usually the nothing of nowhere
    

## How to Build a Monopoly

- Start small and monopolise
    

- Easier to dominate a small market
    
- If you think your initial market is too big, it certainly is
    
- Too much competition with a big market
    

- Expand from small markets
    

- Amazon started with bookstore
    
- eBay started with pez dispensers and beanie babies
    
- Paypal started power sellers on ebay
    
- FB was 10,000 people at Harvard
    

- Start big and you’ll shrink
    

- Every clean tech company 2005-2008 failed because they tried to take on the whole energy market
    

## Last Mover Advantage

- Characteristics of a monopoly
    

- Proprietary technology
    

- Peter Thiel’s thesis is that you should have tech an order of magnitude better than everyone else
    

- Network effects
    

- Tricky because they’re often tough to get started
    
- Why is it valuable to the first person?
    

- Economies of scale
    

- High fixed cost, low marginal cost
    

- Branding
    

- Thiel: I don’t understand it, but it’s important
    

- Critical to have a monopoly that lasts a long time
    

- First movers don’t always win
    
- You want to be the last remaining mover
    

- The value of these companies lasts far into the future
    

- Paypal finance exercise in 2001 showed that ¾ of value was cash flow in 2011 and beyond
    

- Growth rate is overrated, durability is underrated
    

- Growth is easy to measure
    
- Durability is more qualitative
    

- Having the first major breakthrough in an industry, and then being able to explain there will not be another one for some time
    

- Improving on it at a pace that no one else can keep up
    

- Chess analogy:
    

- White is first mover, gains ⅓ pawn advantage
    
- You want to be the last mover, perform the checkmate
    

## History of Innovation

- In science, it is not uncommon for enormous innovation to go unrewarded
    

- In the value equation where a business creates X dollars of value and captures Y% of X, Y has generally been 0 across the board
    
- Fundamental delusion where people think our society is fair and just, and they will simply be rewarded for their contribution
    

- Enormous proportion of history that can be explained from the perspective of captured value
    

- Einstein didn’t make much money
    
- Railroad companies went bust
    
- Wright brothers also went bust
    

- Only 2 broad industries where people innovated something new and captured value after
    

- Complex, vertically integrated companies
    

- Lots of moving parts, difficult to assemble
    
- High value once built and working
    
- No single massive breakthrough
    
- Massive integration
    
- E.g., Tesla, SpaceX, Ford, Standard Oil
    

- Software
    

- Economies of scale
    
- Low marginal cost
    
- High adoption rate
    

- Common rationalisation for scientists who aren’t able to capture value for their innovations
    

- “Scientists shouldn’t be motivated by money”
    

- This is fair, but this rationalisation is dangerous
    
- It means scientists are constantly working in an environment where all the value is competed away, and they’re left with nothing
    

- Important to understand that such rationalisation obscures the fact that X and Y are independent variables
    
- People of equal intelligence doing equally great things in their specific industries can earn vastly different amounts of money
    

- A lot of this has to do with the microeconomics/structure of specific industries
    

## Psychology of Competition

- We often think losers are the ones who are poor at competing
    

- Consider that perhaps competition itself is off
    
- We don’t understand competition/monopoly dichotomy properly
    
- We find ourselves very attracted to competition, a reassurance that there are other people doing this
    

- Competition as validation
    

- We think lots of people doing something is proof of value
    
- PT thinks that is often proof of insanity
    
- 20,000/year move to LA to become movie stars
    

- 20 make it lol
    

- School is one such example of senseless competition
    

- Does the tournament make sense if you keep going?
    
- Does the intensity of competition in grad school make sense?
    
- “The battles were so ferocious because the stakes were so small” - Henry Kissinger referring to academia
    

- This is also proof of insanity
    

- People lose their identities in absurdly competitive environments, they lost sight of what was important
    
- Competition does make you better
    

- But if often comes at the price of questioning what’s truly important/valuable
    
- Don’t get caught up rushing to fit in the tiny door everyone else is trying to get through
    
- Go round the corner and take the vast entrance no one noticed
    

- Risk is a very complicated concept
    

- Taking law as a degree sounds like a low-risk path
    
- But in the grand view of doing something useful with your life, law may be a pretty high-risk entryway into societal improvement
    

# Chapter 5: Growth (Alex Schultz, Growth @ FB)

- What matters most for growth?
    

- Great product
    
- Retention
    

- How do I measure retention best?
    

- Graph of % of active users vs. days since customer acquisition

- To get this curve, measure % of active users on 31st day, 32nd day, 33rd day, etc.
    

- This will give you an idea of the retention trend for your product
    
- Ideally it should flatten out and stabilise at a comfortable level
    

- What if my retention begins to approach 0? What if it never flattens out and stabilises?
    

- DO NOT HIRE A GROWTH HACKER
    
- Head back to the drawing board, focus on finding product-market fit
    
- No. 1 problem with new startups is that they do not have product-market fit when they think they do
    

## Good Retention

- What does good retention look like?
    

- Let’s look at some successful companies:
    

- Use dimensional reasoning
    

- Look at the dimensions involved in a problem
    

- Newtons, n/m, m/s, etc.
    

- FB’s retention rate is easy to figure out
    

- Total no. of internet users (except China) = 2 billion
    
- Facebook’s active user count = 1.3 billion
    
- Retention rate = 1.3/2 = 65%
    

- Whatsapp’s retention
    

- MAU / Total smartphone count
    

- Successful retention rates look different for different companies
    

- Ecommerce: 20-30% is good
    
- Social media: < 80% is probably bad
    

## Scaling

- I have great retention. How do I scale this?
    

- This is where growth teams come in
    

- If you’re a scrappy startup, don’t have a fucking growth team
    
- The whole company should be the growth team
    

- The metric (north star) you choose to measure is important
    

- Zuckerberg chose active users over total signups
    

- It’s not always active users though
    

- Whatsapp used messages sent over no. of users
    
- Airbnb used no. of nights booked vs. major hotel chains
    
- Ebay used total gross merchandise volume instead of revenue
    

- Once a company/team grows beyond a certain size, it’s impossible to directly instruct everyone
    

- But a north star provides guidance to the fundamental end-goal
    
- Affiliate programs are an example of this
    

- Paying your affiliates to meet a specific, well-defined goal gets everybody on the same page, and is much more effective
    
- At ebay they switched the payment requirement from registered users to ACTIVATED registered users (users who bid on something)
    

- Made affiliates focus on driving users to a product instead of driving them to do the bare minimum of registration
    
- For ebay users, seeing the desired product and being allowed to bid on it was the magic moment
    

## The Magic Moment

- What’s the magic moment?
    

- For Facebook, it was seeing your friends on the platform for the first time
    

- That’s why FB growth marketing is all about getting people to connect to their friends as quickly as possible
    
- Zuckerberg called in getting to 10 friends in 14 days
    

- Airbnb is about finding the the cool house you’ve always wanted
    

- For renters, it’s about getting paid for the first time
    

- The magic moment is one the of most important things for a startup
    

- It lets you move the asymptote of the retention line higher and higher
    

- Optimising for power vs marginal users
    

- When building a product/seeking market fit, optimise for the power user
    
- When seeking growth beyond the power user, optimise for marginals
    

## Tactics

- Users will not beat a path to your door
    

- You must work to get users
    

- Internationalisation is important
    

- FB intl’d too late
    

- FB clones everywhere in the world
    
- Knocking down clones is very difficult
    
- Hit a brick wall at 50 million users
    
- Growth team was formed
    

- Even though they were late, they took the time to build it in a scalable way
    

- Wrapped all strings in the site in FPT, FB’s translation engine
    
- Opened community translation options for professional+community translators could work on it
    
- 70/104 languages were community contributed
    
- Language priority was important too
    

- Started with French, Italian, German 
    
- But today these are the lowest no. of users
    
- Luckily FPT + community allowed FB languages to scale anyway
    

- Negative demonstration: Uber
    

- Kicked out of many markets because expansion was too rapid, not localised enough
    

### Virality

#### PFC

- Think about virality in terms of 3 things
    

- Payload
    

- How many people can you hit with each blast
    

- Frequency
    

- How many times can you hit someone per blast
    

- Conversion rate
    

- % of people who came onboard
    

- Hotmail added a link to bottom of every email ‘sent with hotmail, get free email here’
    

- Payload was low (1 to 1 emails sent)
    
- Frequency was high (lots of email sent)
    
- CR was high (great product)
    

- Paypal used ebay as a vehicle for viral marketing
    

- Payload was low (1 to 1)
    
- Frequency was low (people don’t get paid that often)
    
- CR was SUPER high (you got paid! That’s the magic moment!)
    

- Frequency and conversion rate are related
    

- Hitting someone with the same ad again and again lowers conversion rate
    

#### K-factor

- K-factor = i * (c1 * c2 * c3 * ….)
    

- Where i is average number of new persons invited per customer
    
- c is % of people who get onboarded at every step
    

- E.g., c1 is % of ppl who opened the link
    
- C2 is % of ppl who registered
    
- C3 is % of people who activated their accounts
    

- if k-factor > churn, more users come than users leave, and your product is going to have exponential growth
    
- if k-factor = churn, the virality only compensates the churn, and the number of users will be stable
    
- if k-factor < churn, the churn of users is not compensated by the virality and audience of the project will gradually decline
    
- Virality/k-factor fluctuates
    

- Use paid channels (adwords, FB) to stabilise growth rate
    
- Virality for big wins
    

### SEO

#### Keywords

- What do people search for?
    
- How many people search for it?
    
- How many other companies are ranking for it?
    
- How valuable is it for you?
    
- Optimise using Google keyword planner tool
    

#### Backlinks

- Get valuable links from high authority websites
    
- Distribute love within your site by internal links
    
- Internal site directories are great
    
- XML headers
    

#### Email

- Delivery is most important, then open/click rate
    
- Dead for people under 25
    
- Instant messaging is far more powerful
    
- Take note what servers your email is being sent on
    

- Dirty IPs will send you straight to spam
    

- Newsletters are stupid
    

- The messages for a 3 year veteran user and a newbie are different
    
- Notification emails are far more important
    

- As a FB veteran, you don’t want to receive emails/SMS for a new like
    
- But a newbie or low engagement person would love to know about the likes they get
    

## A violently executed okay plan today is better than a perfect one tomorrow.

# Chapter 6: How to Build Products Users Love (Kevin Hale)

- Growth is simple
    

- Conversion rate vs churn
    
- The gap between the two shows how much you will grow
    

- The motivations to get to a billion dollars are the same as the first dollar
    
- Kevin built wufoo, a friendly contact form builder
    

- Acquired by surveymonkey in 2013
    
- Only raised about 100k USD
    
- Exited at 35M USD
    
- Profit: 29561% (LOL)
    
- What did they do differently?
    

- They were fanatical about creating meaningful relationships with users
    

- New users: dating, existing users: marriage
    
- First impressions matter
    

- First kiss, how you proposed
    
- No free pass if your date picks their nose
    
- But married couples shrug that sort of thing off
    

- Same with companies
    

- Make all your ‘first moments’ memorable
    

- First emil
    
- Account creation
    
- blank/starting interface
    
- Login link
    
- Ad link
    
- First customer support
    

### Dating (First Impressions)

- Japanese 2 marks of quality
    

- Taken-for-granted quality
    

- A good pen can write well
    

- Enchanting quality
    

- The way the pen feels, the way ink flows, etc.
    
- The little details matter
    
- What’s the user’s first emotion as they interact with this?
    
- Little tweaks and quirks of the product make people fall in love
    
- ![](../03%20-%20MEDIA%20&%20FILES/9c20553c07d06c941c8b5a9f32aaca7a_MD5.png)
    

- Companies tend to have beautiful marketing and horrible user guides
    

- ![](../03%20-%20MEDIA%20&%20FILES/63ad7b33ce0c34d8d0012c18cb8c3712_MD5.png)
    
- Opportunities exist even in seemingly boring avenues for product delight
    

- Mailchimp switched user guide document covers to look like magazine covers
    

- Readership went up, support calls went down
    

- On Stripe, if you’re logged in, the API example code already has your API keys filled in
    
- When Wufoo wanted to launch their API, they didnt do a hackathon
    

- They gave out a custom battle axe (lmao)
    
- ![](../03%20-%20MEDIA%20&%20FILES/48ea6e80c80abcd3e9ae127cd874f024_MD5.png)
    

### Marriage (Existing Users)

- How do relationships work in the long term?
    

- Short term conflicts can indicate long term durability
    
- All couples fight and it’s about the same things as companies
    
- ![](../03%20-%20MEDIA%20&%20FILES/ddf27d6bd3edae40d5f8e618842138db_MD5.png)
    

  

- Engineers/software devs do not often feel the consequences of what they build
    

- How do we fix the feedback loop, so even the technical team is accountable for the user experience?
    

#### Support Driven Development

- Things that screw up relationships
    

- Criticism
    

- The support sucks, you’re not helpful at all
    

- Contempt
    

- Purposeful insult
    

- Defensiveness
    

- Trying not to take responsibility
    

- Stonewalling
    

- This is the worst
    
- Straight up ignoring customer request
    

- Wufoo built empathy into their support forms with an ‘Emotion’ drop down field
    

- This was an optional field, but was filled >75% of the time
    
- Indicates that a user feels that their emotional state was just as important as their technical details
    
- An outlet for emotion allowed users to vent
    
- People started being nicer - use of curse/caps/exclamations went down
    

- Make sure everyone does customer support
    

- Responsible devs and designers give the best support
    
- Once a dev hears the same problem 2-3 times, it gets fixed
    

- Everybody in Wufoo did customer support (sometimes with day shift rotations)
    

- 500,000 users got support from 10 people
    
- Support time was about 7-12 minutes during working hours
    

-   
    

#### Direct Exposure

- More exposure to users produced better software
    

- Sharing support duties is a great way to do this
    
- Direct exposure every 2 weeks for at least 2 hours is best
    

- Knowledge gap is the gap between your user’s knowledge level and the minimum required to use your app
    

- You either educate the user well
    
- Or lower the barrier of entry
    

- Great help/documentation
    
- Contextual help pages
    
- Make the app simpler to get going with
    

- For Wufoo, Great UX and support meant
    

- Support requests grew slowly compared to user count
    
- Lower churn rate
    
- New user increased
    
- Team size remain small (this also means everyone gets more equity)
    
- Culture maintained
    

### Relationships Atrophy

- Relationships need work
    

- AND you need to show-off that work
    
- Newsletter and blogs showing off new features are not very effective
    

- Wufoo introduced Alerts, which show new updates (work done) when a user logs in after a while
    

- Users felt grateful because the team appeared to be working for them all the time
    
- ![](../03%20-%20MEDIA%20&%20FILES/b166b039b4aaed9eba114bdc97bdc9f0_MD5.png)
    

- Every Friday, Wufoo team would write handwritten thank you notes to users
    

- Humanises the company
    
- Retention is way better
    

# Chapter 7: How to Get Started, Doing Things that Don't Scale, Press (Stanley Tang @ Doordash, Walker Williams @ Teespring, Justin Kan @ Twitch)

## How to Get Started (Stanley)

- Went from idea to website in an hour
    
- Started paloaltodelivery.com
    
- Customers streamed in 100% organically
    
- Only began to scale when demand began becoming crazy
    
- Keep asking for feedback, do the dirty work yourself for as long as possible
    
- Only scale when you have to
    

## Doing Things That Don’t Scale (Walker)

- Initial user acquisition was very painful
    
- Getting a small non-profit to buy $1000 worth of t-shirts was a lot of work
    
- Speed is more important than scalability/optimisation in the early days
    

- Teespring split codebase into 2 just to accommodate some enterprise customers
    
- Smashed code into duplicate just to ship features to enterprise without affecting existing users
    
- Slowly integrated new core features into original codebase
    

- Teespring almost died recently, shrank to 30 employees
    

- Victim of its own success
    
- The power sellers were doing so well that they found economics of doing t-shirts themselves was better
    

## Press (Justin)

### Target Audience

- Press should have a target audience and goals
    

- If you don’t have a clear business goal/audience, garnering press is a waste of time
    

- Investors
    
- Customers 
    
- Industry
    

### The Story

- You need a good story
    

- Types of stories:
    

- Product launches
    
- Fundraising
    
- Milestones
    
- Business overviews
    
- Stunts
    
- Hiring announcements
    
- Contributed articles
    

- Think about your story objectively - not everything you do is interesting
    
- You don’t always have to be original - just original enough
    

- Mechanics of a story
    

- Think of a story
    
- Get introduced
    
- Set a date (4-7 days in advance)
    
- Reach out (get a commitment to invest in time)
    
- Pitch
    
- Follow up
    
- Launch your news!
    

### Launching

- Ask an entrepreneur who was recently featured by them for a referral
    

- Give a week lead time for this
    

- Executing the launch
    

- Write the story in bullet points
    

- Memorise it
    
- When you get interviewed, you will tell it like it is written
    

- Follow-up
    

- Thanks for meeting
    
- Videos/photos
    
- Here’s our launch date
    

- PR firms are of limited use
    

- They can get contacts
    
- Can’t produce stories for you
    
- Expensive
    

- Getting press is a lot of work
    

- Make sure it’s worth it
    
- Getting press doesn’t mean you’re successful
    
- Press is not a scalable user acquisition strategy
    

- If you decide press is worth it
    

- Keep contacts fresh
    
- Regular heartbeat of news (consistency is key)
    
- Golden rule
    

- Pay it forward. Always.
    
- Karma always comes round

# Chapter 8: How to Raise Money (Marc Andreessen, Ron Conway, Parker Conrad)

- What do VCs look for?
    

- Of all the companies receiving funding every year, only 15 generate 97% of returns
    
- Strength instead of lack of weakness
    

- If a startup checks all the boxes and shows no weakness, but likewise has no killer strength, they are unlikely to be in the big 15
    
- If they are so good in some aspects, and have tolerable flaws in others, still worth investing
    

- Have the one compelling statement for your product
    

- For the investor to picture the product in their mind
    
- Practise this like crazy
    

- Be decisive
    

- Don’t procrastinate on important decisions
    
- Part of building a great team
    

- Communication skills and leadership are no. 1
    
- Be so good they can’t ignore you
    

- Willing to tolerate flaws
    
- It’s worth more to make your business better than to make your pitch better
    

- YOUR REPUTATION IS YOUR BIGGEST ASSET
    

- That said, you can get a lot done with not a lot of rep
    
- But positive rep will serve you well
    

  

![](../03%20-%20MEDIA%20&%20FILES/1659475f625b272fa764799a4d5f2768_MD5.png)

- Bootstrap as long as you possibly can
    
- Raising venture capital is the easiest thing a startup will ever do
    

- If you have a difficult time raising funds, it means that the work you have to do on your startup is going to be 10x harder
    

- Recruitment, product, etc.
    

## The Onion Theory of Risk

- A systematic approach to thinking about how cash gets deployed in risk mitigation
    
- A new startup has every conceivable kind of risk
    

- Founding team risk
    
- Product risk
    
- Technical risk
    
- Launch risk
    
- Acceptance risk
    
- Revenue risk
    
- Cost of sale risk
    

- Raising money is a tool to peel away layers of risk
    

- More money means you can pay your founding team, building product, recruit eng team, etc.
    
- Those are the true milestones
    
- The money itself is not a milestone
    
- Be very clear what milestones you’re attempting to solve with every raise, and fundraising will become much easier and targeted
    

## General Advice

- Don’t ask someone to sign an NDA
    

- Build trust between parties
    

- ALWAYS get things in writing
    

- Do fundraising as quickly and efficiently as possible
    
- But always get things on record
    
- Take notes
    

- When you meet and agree on verbal terms, do up an email, and ask for confirmation on what they just said to you
    

- Investors have short memories and commitment
    

- SV Angel on seed raising
    

- Invest in 1 mil to 2 mil rounds
    
- 1/30 acceptance rate, about 1 new company a week
    
- Team votes if company is worth bringing on for a phone call and then a physical meeting
    
- Followed by background checks on company, founding team
    
- Following by checks on all other investors in the round
    

- A16z on series A
    

- Most VCs at this stage only look at 2 types of companies
    

- Seed raised?
    

- Best way to get the attention of series A investors is through referrals from seed investors or places like YC
    

- What terms should founders care most about?
    

- Finding the right investors
    

- YC does a good job telling who those people are
    

- Picking the right threshold valuations
    

- How much equity should the company give away during seed?
    

- 20-30% at series A
    
- 10-15% at seed
    
- Founders should ask at what valuation they get demotivated
    

- What signs should you avoid an investor
    

- No domain expertise
    
- No rolodex
    
- Choosing an investor is like marriage under great stress and anxiety
    

- What constraints do investors have when bringing companies in?
    

- Opportunity cost 
    

- Every investment made rules out conflicts
    
- One investment locks out that category
    
- Time and bandwidth of general partners
    
- GPs could have done other deals over that time
    

# Chapter 9: Hiring & Culture (Airbnb, Stripe, Pinterest)

- The most important thing when maintaining company integrity for scaling
    
- What is company culture?
    

- Every A and B of each member of the team in pursuit of our company C
    

- A = assumptions, beliefs, values
    
- B = behaviours, actions
    
- C = goals, BHAG, mission
    

- Why does this matter?
    

- First principles
    
- Alignment
    
- Stability
    
- Trust
    
- Exclusion
    
- Retention
    

- How to establish core values
    

- What values are most important to you?
    
- What are the most important values for business success?
    
- What do you look for in employees?
    
- What could NEVER be tolerated?
    
- Remember to incorporate your mission into your values
    

- Company values must have depth
    

- Honesty, service, teamwork DON’T CUT IT.
    

- Elements of high performing teams
    

- ![](../03%20-%20MEDIA%20&%20FILES/657991542701ac17980335beee5508f9_MD5.png)
    

- Best practices for culture
    

- Incorporate your mission to your values
    
- Think harder and deeper about values
    
- Interview from cultural fit
    
- Evaluate performance on culture as well
    
- Make culture a daily habit
    

## Q&A with Airbnb

- How did you realise culture was important at Airbnb?
    

- I found 2 great teammates who I admired
    
- Great shared way of working and doing things
    
- Mission was very clear
    
- Bringing that mission to the whole company was important
    
- Looked at big companies, Apple, Amazon, Nike
    
- Even looked at nations
    
- All had strong declarations and values to endure the test of time
    

- What did you learn about Culture from Zappos?
    

- 3 or 5 unique values from every other person
    
- Wrote down core values before hiring anyone
    

- Why did you take 3-5 months to hire your first engineer?
    

- It was like bringing DNA to the company
    
- There would be 1000 more people like him/her that would join the company in the future
    
- Diversity of background, age, gender etc.
    

- But no diversity of values
    

- On what basis did you hire
    

- All about the mission
    
- Not just about putting people in rooms when travelling
    
- It’s about bringing people together, so you can belong anywhere
    
- “If you had 10 years left to live, would you join this company”
    
- Looking for people that are looking for a calling
    

- Remaining scrappy frugal and creative
    

- It’s easy to lose that scrappiness once you’re big
    
- Reminder as part of core values to always be creative and not rest on laurels
    

- How did culture help you make important decisions?
    

- Clarity of decision
    
- Promise to only hire world-class with cultural fit was natural
    
- Rocket Internet attempted to copy and destroy Airbnb with high raise and aggressive hiring
    
- The logical thing was for Airbnb to buy them or risk getting destroyed by them
    
- Brian felt they were mercenaries just for the money, while Airbnb were missionaries
    
- Chose not to buy and maintain integrity with core values
    

- Culture and brand are two side of the same coin
    

- Whatever happens inside the company bleeds into your external image
    
- Brand is your connection between you and your customers
    
- Strong culture can be a brand in and of itself
    
- Apple decided that the way to sell computers wasn’t to talk about bits and bytes
    

- It was to talk about values (Think Different Campaign)
    
- We believe in these passions and values
    
- If you buy our products, you believe in these too
    
- Avoid being a utility
    

- How do you know how to communicate this early in the days?
    

- Early on Airbnb pitched itself like a utility
    
- Changed to ‘travel like a human’
    

- How did you make sure the hosts enforce culture of Airbnb?
    

- Anybody should be able to use Airbnb
    
- Implemented the Superhost program
    

- Hitting milestones and providing great service earns superhost status
    
- Grants perks, better rates, visibility
    

- Organised host conference on reinforcing values
    

- Open source community?
    

- Airbnb thought it could be proprietary technology
    
- But they also wanted to keep their tech open
    
- Instead they made their defensibility about service
    

- Be loved instead of liked
    

- 100 people loving you is better than 1m liking you
    
- The 100 people are your own viral marketing
    

- To get these 100, do things that don’t scale
    
- Airbnb went out manually photographing everybody’s homes for a better experience
    

## Q&A with Stripe and Pinterest

- What are the most important pieces of culture in your compmanies
    

- Pinterest
    

- Hires
    
- What do we do everyday
    
- What we choose to communicate
    
- What we choose celebrate
    

- Stripe
    

- Transparency internally
    
- If everyone is aligned at a high level, and everyone has good access to info and current state of stripe, big step towards working productively
    
- Culture is a resolution of a bandwidth problem
    

- You can’t make decisions for hundreds of employees
    
- Culture allows you to spread strands into getting all employees being aligned
    

- What did you look for when hiring the first 10 to get culture right?
    

- Pinterest
    

- Who do I want to work with, and I find talented
    
- It’s not architecture, it’s gardening
    

- Planting seeds and removing weeds and letting the garden grow
    

- Worked hard, high integrity, low ego
    
- People with quirks outside of being good engineers
    
- Wanting to build something big
    

- Stripe
    

- Biggest influence on the company
    
- Their friends will tell them not to join
    
- Had to find people who were undervalued
    
- Biggest similarities with first 10
    

- Genuine and straightforward
    
- Deep into finishing things
    
- Cared a great deal (offended when something was off)
    

- Takes a long time to recruit people, so getting people around you excited early is important
    

- How do you tell someone is good?
    

- Difficult to discern for categories you don’t have expertise/taste in
    

- Must establish what makes someone world-class
    
- Ask an already world-class person what defines characteristics in that area
    

- Important to be transparent about the vision, why the company is good
    

- Lay out the gory details of why it’ll be hard
    
- Weeds out candidates
    

- Work with the person as much as you can
    

- Usually for a week on small project
    

- Look for references
    

- Important to know what this person was like to work with
    

- What do you do to make someone effective ASAP?
    

- Pinterest
    

- When small, it was about setting up their PC, getting them up to speed ASAP
    
- Getting to know the person more deeply happened naturally, having spent time together in a scrappy company
    
- When bigger, it’s a UX exercise to onboard new people
    
- What does the person see, who they meet, what they start by doing
    

- Stripe
    

- Get them coding/in meetings on the first day
    
- Push people off the cliff on the first day
    
- Give people feedback on how they’re doing adapting to the culture
    

- How do you convince people to join you when success is not guaranteed
    

- Stripe
    

- People often join BECAUSE its not guaranteed
    
- Appeal to them on a personal development angle
    
- Startups are a great place to benchmark impact and contribution
    

- Pinterest
    

- No one is under the illusion that you will 100% succeed
    
- If they are afraid of this, they’re not as intelligent as you think
    

- How has your user base affected your hiring strategy?
    

- Pinterest
    

- Ambition about the mission is most important
    
- They don’t need to be lifelong power users
    
- If they’re not currently users, it’s good to bring them on so they can remove the barriers they faced
    

- Stripe
    

- We hired 4 Stripe users early
    
- They understood the product right away
    

# Chapter 10: Building for the Enterprise (Aaron Levie, CEO @ Box)

- Look for underlying environmental factors that are set to change drastically
    

- For Box, the price of storage was dropping significantly
    

- Box fell into the trap of
    

- Over-serving consumers (free tier)
    

- How do you monetise?
    

- Under-serving businesses
    

- Insufficient security
    
- Enterprise capabilities
    

## The State of Enterprise

- Enterprise IT market size is several orders of magnitude larger than mobile apps + digital marketing/ads
    

- Enterprise is less concerned with dollars and cents vs. improving performance
    

- Enterprise software was unsexy and slow
    

- Building it it slow to prevent customer breakdowns
    
- Sales are slow because of long deal-making process
    
- No love and care for design and UX
    

- Enterprise software has changed drastically
    

- Cloud computing
    

- AWS put together lots of servers available on demand
    

- Compute power is cheap
    
- Standardisation of enterprise software lets companies go after small startups and giant MNCs
    
- Easy internationalisation
    
- User-led instead of IT department dictated
    

- 2 billion mobile phones and growing
    
- 3 billion users online and growing
    
- Examples of spaces suited to new innovation
    

- Multi-channel retail experiences
    

- Online, mobile, physical, delivery
    

- Personalised healthcare
    
- Media creation and distribution
    

## How do you get started?

- Spot technology disruptions
    

- Look for new enabling tech that creates a gap between how things have been done and can be done
    
- What has a drop in price/complexity of technology allowed you to do now that didn’t work 5 years ago?
    
- EXAMPLE: PlanGrid realised construction industry was printing $4b worth of blueprints, and decided to augment that with cloud and mobile
    

- Intentionally start small
    

- Find a natural wedge - simple and small. A gap in current solutions that a customer would want a discrete solution for
    
- Expand over time
    
- If people call it a toy, you’re onto something
    
- EXAMPLE: Gusto, SaaS for payroll. Now moved into HR, benefits, etc.
    

- Find asymmetries
    

- Do things that incumbents won’t do because they are not economically/technically feasible
    
- Be platform agnostic compared to incumbents who can’t adapt to all competitor software
    
- Monetize customers from a unique perspective that would be too expensive or too small for a big company to pursue
    
- EXAMPLE: Zenefits HR software targeting benefits for small businesses. Earns money from insurance commissions
    

- Find almost-crazy outliers
    

- Live in the future, and figure out what’s missing
    
- EXAMPLE: Skycatch does enterprise data collection with drones
    

- Listen to customers
    

- But don’t build what they tell you - distill their requests into what they need
    
- EXAMPLE: Palantir takes in unclear customer data requests, distills into key valuable insights
    

- Be modular, not customised
    

- Don’t customise and be bespoke to each company
    
- Difficult to maintain
    
- Think about pluggable modules instead
    
- EXAMPLE: SalesForce
    

- Focus on the user
    

- Keep consumer DNA at the core of your product
    
- Makes adoption easier
    

- Product should sell itself
    

- Sales is important to navigate and close deals, but a great product is still key
    

# Chapter 11: How to be a Great Founder (Reid Hoffman @ LinkedIn)

- Founders are often seen as superwoman/man
    

- Many skills, abilities, element of divinity
    

- Truth is that founders have to deal with a multiple of headaches
    

- One hopes to have a few unique skills
    
- Competitive edge is important
    

## Questions for Founders

- How do I put together a founding team?
    

- Best to be on a team of 2 to 3
    

- Solo is not ideal
    
- Compensate for weaknesses
    
- Tackle diversity of problems
    

- Where should I locate my startup?
    

- Seek the networks that best fit your endeavour
    
- Groupon wouldn’t have worked in SV
    

- SV people are adverse to massive sales forces 
    

- Should I be contrarian?
    

- Find something that smart people disagree with you on
    
- What do I know that other people don’t?
    
- Critics said LinkedIn wouldn’t work because of the vast amount of network effects needed to get going
    
- LinkedIn knew that he could leverage different sets of interests to get people on board to try the product in a short span of time
    

- When should I do the work vs. delegation?
    

- Sometimes one, the other, or both
    

- Should I be flexible or persistent?
    

- When should I be either?
    
- You should have an investment thesis to decide this
    

- Why you think this is a good idea
    
- What you think you know but other people don’t
    
- Are you increasing in confidence for your investment thesis?
    
- If decreasing, find out what is causing the decrease, and form an immediate action plan
    

- Should I be confident or cautious
    

- Confidence in your own ideas, but be smart enough to listen to sharp feedback, criticism, competitive entries
    
- Is this changing my investment thesis?
    
- How do I adapt?
    

- Should I focus internally or externally?
    
- Should I work by vision or data?
    

- Data only exists within the framework of a larger vision
    
- Measure what you need to move towards a vision
    

- Should I take risks or minimise risks?
    

- Taking calculated risk is part of business
    
- But minimising risk within that framework is one of your most important jobs
    
- Aka optimising chances of success
    
- Start with the thesis
    

- Is every step we take increasing or decreasing confidence in the thesis?
    

- Should I focus on long or short term?
    

- Daily/weekly todo lists have to play towards a larger path
    

- How do I know I’m a great founder?
    

- Helps to be a great product person
    
- Leadership at bringing networks and persuasion
    
- Recognising macro view if you’re on track
    

- Paranoia vs. confidence
    

- There is no single skill set
    

- Ability to continuously learn and adapt
    
- Take in input from multiple sources
    
- Creating networks around you
    

## Q&A with Reid Hoffman

- How did you target the early adopters that would strengthen LinkedIn
    

- Our strategy won’t work today
    
- Too much noise today
    
- Strategy today has to be standing out from the crowd
    

- How do you know someone’s a good founder?
    

- I believe in references the most
    
- Insight into someone before they show up is often the best way
    

- The ability to say coherently what you’re targeting - a focused sentence - is important
    

- Level of clarity and articulation is key to being a good founder
    

- How did LinkedIn remain persistent throughout hard times?
    

- Kept returning back to thesis of wanting professional profiles for everyone
    
- No one is getting closer to it than they were
    

- What are the ways of being fooled into thinking a founder is good when they’re actually rubbish?
    

- I like to push on someone’s idea, and see if they’re able to remain flexible and persistent on it
    

- “I stand by this idea, but i’m listening to what you’re saying”
    

- What makes a great co-founder team, how to evaluate?
    

- Collaborate really well, do they help each other get to truth?
    
- Collective learning makes great teams
    
- Do you have diversity of strengths across the skills that are useful
    

- Different founders, different areas, how do you identify them?
    

- What’s common across all great ounders?
    

- Software needs speed
    
- Hardware needs accuracy
    

- Domain-specific founders
    

- Attributes that are unique to domain
    
- E.g., operational efficiency and cost control is important for commerce
    
- for digital game startups like Zynga is not as important
    

- When should you stay when something is taking longer than it should? (When to pivot)
    

- Confidence in investment thesis
    

- Unmeasured or decreasing for a long time
    
- Intense phase to try and increase confidence
    
- Increasing fails
    
- Time to pivot
    

- Founders have no balance
    

- Intense, lopsided focus for periods of time are necessary
    

- Creating markets vs. discovering them?
    

- Creating a market is usually either completely worthless or a big opportunity
    

- What about my investment thesis can tell me whether this is a good opportunity or not?
    

- How do you know you trust someone enough to be a cofounder
    

- It’s a risk
    
- Establishing at least 20 hours of conversation and time spent together
    
- What would tell me this isn’t working?
    

- Hash this out and converse about it
    

# Chapter 12: How to Operate (Keith Rabois, Khosla, Square)

- Building companies is harder than products
    
- Company building starts from a lovingly drawn-out plan
    

- Plan when put into practice is never as clean, held together by people working 100 hours a week
    
- Eventually one wants to build a high performance engine, able to operate without much oversight
    
- “If martians took over ebay, no one would notice for quite a while”
    

- A manager’s output = output organisation + output neighbouring organisation
    
- Triaging
    

- Company begins in mess and chaos
    
- If there aren’t new problems and challenges everyday, it means you’re not innovating or creating fast enough
    
- The idea here is that you’re triaging
    
- Discerning colds from pneumonia, figuring out where priorities for problem solving lie
    

- Editing
    

- Simplify and eliminate
    

- The more you simplify, the better your team will perform
    
- Easily understood > complexity
    

- GOAL: reduce amount of corrections/interjections needed to keep team on track
    

- It’s okay to need to make lots of corrections on a bad day
    
- But this should reduce month to month, quarter to quarter as the company gets tighter
    

  

- Clarify
    

- Ask a lot of question to seek clarification
    
- Clarifying makes sure the problem statement is clear, everyone is on same page
    
- Improves overall performance
    

- Allocate resources
    

- Moving your resources around to favour the landscape
    
- Initiatives to new resource allocation can come top down
    
- But ideally they should come bottom up
    
- Employees seek initiative to do new and useful things, which you then approve as an editor
    

- Ensure consistent voice
    

- Make sure all external/internal media sounds like it was written by one person
    
- Keep the tone of the company consistent
    
- Apple is one of the best at this
    

- Delegate
    

- Abdicate vs micromanagement
    
- You do not do most of the work, but you are responsible for all of it
    
- How to manage without abdicating?
    

- Task-relevant maturity framework
    
- If someone has low maturity, needs more hand-holding
    
- If someone has done this a lot, monitor and set high objectives
    

- A leader cannot have a single management style
    

- Style is dictated by employee, and matters what make that employee most effective
    

- How to decide when to delegate or take control?
    
- ![](../03%20-%20MEDIA%20&%20FILES/ef6017754e2c643f156663dfae831701_MD5.png)
    

- Edit the Team
    

- Increasing worker count is not always the best way to increase work done
    
- Barrel analogy
    

- Most people (even great employees) are ammunition
    
- More ammunition is great, but rate of fire is limited by number of barrels (people who channel and increase throughput)
    
- Velocity of company increases when you have more barrels and stock them with ammunition
    
-   
    

- Scaling
    

- ![](../03%20-%20MEDIA%20&%20FILES/eee652061f66e5b2368b4afbdd4bf92f_MD5.png)
    
- Note employee personal growth rates vs company growth rates
    
- Only keep employees who can keep pace with the company
    
- If employees can outpace the company - good! Keep them in new roles constantly
    

- Insist on Focus
    

- Keep employees focused on some very key roles, don’t stretch them thin
    

- Metrics & Transparency
    

- In order for you to not to have to make all the decisions, provide tools so that everybody can see and make decision for themselves
    

- Build an internal dashboard that tracks metrics that are in line with company goals
    
- Monitor usage of the dashboard - make sure it’s intuitive, useful and empowering
    

- Make sure all meeting notes and metrics are available to everyone in the company
    
- Compensation should be open as well
    
- Gathering information by pairing indicators: measure effect and counter effects
    

- Release criteria vs ship date
    
- Number of hires vs quality of hires
    
- Loss rate vs false positives
    

- Building positive work environment + insisting every part of the company meets standards
    

- Ensuring receptionist answers the phone properly
    
- Serving good food
    
- Working on small things - taking distractions away from employees is one of the key roles for a COO
    

- Effort
    

- Lead by example
    

# Chapter 13: How to Manage (Ben Horowitz)

- When making a critical decision, you must understand how it will be interpreted from each person’s point of view, and their perspective as a whole (culture)
    

## Demote or Fire?

- Executive is great, works hard, well-liked, but not world-class at running his function
    

- CEO thinks
    

- Tough to fire a great employee
    
- Demotion is good cus you can keep him 
    
- No cultural backlash
    

- Exec thinks
    

- Doesn’t want demotion, but provides an option
    
- Saves embarrassment of getting fired
    
- Able to keep growing with the company
    

- Everyone else thinks
    

- Does he keep the same equity package?
    
- Is he gonna work as hard now that he reports to someone else?
    
- Do I have the same respect now that he’s demoted?
    

- The real questions here are:
    

- What does it mean to fail on your job?
    
- What does it mean to maintain your equity?
    

## Excellent Employee Asks for Raise

- CEO thinks
    

- Want to retain them
    
- They did great job, it’s fair
    
- They will like you if you give them the raise and you want to be liked
    

- Employee thinks
    

- WOOHOO MONEY
    

- Everybody Else
    

- Unfair that I didn’t get a raise
    
- I did better work, so doubly unfair
    
- Maybe I should quit
    

- Conclusion
    

- Everybody feels a responsibility to ask for a raise personally
    
- Encouraging behaviour
    

- Right answer
    

- Formal performance evaluation process
    
- All the right inputs
    
- Run evaluations as frequently as possible
    
- No raises outside of the process
    

## History’s Greatest Practitioner

### Toussaint L’Overture

- Born an african slave
    
- Wanted to end slavery, take control of Haiti, make it first class
    
- Soldier’s perspective
    

- Do we get to pillage? We enjoy pillaging
    
- If they get to kill us, we should get to kill them
    

- Culture
    

- He banned rape and pillaging in his army to protect the resultant culture
    
- Toussaint wanted a first-class culture
    
- He believed Haitian culture was inferior to European, and slave culture the worst of all
    

- Whenever he defeated a European power, he would capture and make their leaders his generals
    

### Dealing with Slaves and Slave Owners After Victory

- Slave perspectives
    

- Free us, we fought for this
    
- Kill the owners
    
- Give us their land
    

- Toussaint perspective
    

- Economy is important, and productive plantation are important
    
- We’re mostly slaves
    
- We don’t have the expertise to run sugar plantations
    
- We earned that land
    

- Slave owner perspective
    

- Our business is predicated on slave labour
    
- We paid a lot of money for the slaves
    
- We paid for the land
    
- We have all the skill and relationships, so you have to deal business with us
    

- Solution
    

- End slavery
    
- Let the slave owners keep land
    
- Require plantation owners to pay salaries to workers
    
- Lower the plantation owner taxes so they can keep business going
    

- Result
    

- Only successful slave revolution
    
- Let plantation owners keep land
    
- Booming economy
    
- Under Toussaint, Haiti had more export income than USA
    

- Conclusion
    

- Seek perspectives of the people not in the room
    
- Think of the company
    
- Think of the culture
    

# Chapter 14: Great User Interviews (Emmett Shear @ Twitch)

## Twitch Story

- Started with Kiko Calendar which was built without talking to any users - did not even use calendars themselves
    
- Then built Justin.tv which they used themselves, so they could get away with not talking to other users
    
- Could not figure out how to scale justin.tv beyond their narrow use case
    
- Pivoted to Twitch, at which point they had to learn about video game broadcasting
    
- Determined that broadcasters were the most important users
    
- Gathered feedback from existing broadcasters on Twitch.tv
    

- Feedback was consistent, clear, led clear feature requests
    
- People wanted small features like banlists, removal of trolls, polls
    
- Emmett argues if they are willing to put up with these problems and still use the platform, these problems are not the highest priority
    

- Instead, gathered feedback from broadcasters on competitor platforms
    

- Feedback was completely different
    
- People wanted revenue sharing, better video service, stability
    

- Gathered feedback from non-broadcasters who want to broadcast
    

- This is the most important, as they are the people you want to bring on to expand the size of the market
    
- Feedback was different again
    
- People say PCs aren’t fast enough, not enough time because training, publishing strategy online was bad for competitive teams
    
- Led to the team trying to make broadcasting more accessible
    

- Building Twitch into Xbox, PS4, 
    

## Conducting the Interviews

- Who you talk to is as important as the questions you ask
    
- Where do you go to find target users?
    
- Initial questionnaires should not focus on specific user flows or features
    

- These are distractions
    

- Listen out for big blockers - is there something inherently wrong with the way people feel about it?
    
- Identify one key feature that puts your new product one level above the competition
    
- Next ask yourself - is it worth it? Is this worth building into a product?
    
- Validation can happen 2 ways
    

- Actually build it (if you’re good at code)
    
- Draw out diagrams/work flow and show it to people
    

- Don’t fall into the trap of asking ‘is this feature good or not?’
    

- People will usually say its gr8
    

- Can get them to pay for it up front - money where your mouth is 
    

## Q&A

- What are the most common mistakes?
    

- Don’t show people your product. It’s like telling them the feature to look at
    
- Talk to people you need to, not the people you have access to
    

- How hard is it to get buy-in from the rest of the company to build something?
    

- Record and show your team the interviews
    

- Do you insist on Skype interviews or email?
    

- Avoid email interviews, as the best parts of the an interview usually come from questions outside of the script
    

- What about reaching people in intl market to do interviews?
    

- Twitch admittedly still works best in english speaking countries
    
- Tried to solve this by hiring Korean speaking folks, translators, etc.
    

- What channels did you use to reach out and did you compensate?
    

- On-site messaging systems
    
- Events
    
- No compensation
    

- What about on-site user feedback on the product?
    

- It’s great for testing a product pre-launch
    
- It doesn’t tell you what to build next
    

- What makes good user feedback?
    

- Want to learn about what user is really thinking
    
- Problems, get to know them as a person
    
- Don’t colour their opinions with your influence
    

# Chapter 15: How to Design Hardware Products (Hosain Rahman @ Jawbone)

- Started straight out of school
    
- Developed core technology, built products around that
    
- Started with headset that became a wearable computer
    
- Kick-started wireless audio space around bluetooth
    
- Focus should shift away from vast system of internet of things
    

- Focus on the users - personal wearables
    

- To do this, you need to be great at the full stack
    

- Hardware
    
- Software
    
- Services
    
- Data
    

- All these verticals require different skills and disciplines
    

- Initial merge of hardware and software created friction within the company
    
- Software used to moving fast, hardware iterations slow
    
- Hardware team needed to learn to move fast, software team learnt to focus on experience before shipping
    

## Product Development Flow

- How does Jawbone create?

## The Experience Framework

![](../03%20-%20MEDIA%20&%20FILES/750495eec6b255a4405456e1c732b128_MD5.png)

- Whys
    

- What is the core user problem?
    
- That once we solve, users can’t live without?
    

- For Jawbone, the introduction of a $199 speaker for your mobile phone was unthinkable to a regular user or focus group
    
- But once released, it dominated 78% of the market
    

- EXAMPLE: Audio experience
    

- My content isn’t as mobile as it could be
    

- It’s all concentrated on my mobile
    

- The content should be seamless across time and space
    
- For Jawbone, speakers were the way to get into homes and become the hub of service and software
    

- Experience Continuum
    

- How to flow users into a ‘future world’
    
- Allows thinking about feature trade-offs
    

- If we can’t add feature to current gen, users will be ready for it when next gen comes
    

- TODAY
    

- Beautiful portable speakers that seamlessly sync music content
    

- TOMORROW
    

- Introduce occasion-based listening experiences that reinforce portability, extensibility, social engagement through hardware, software, services
    

- FUTURE
    

- Full ecosystem of aware, autonomous products
    
- Adapt to user’s environment, habits, audio sources
    

- It’s all about creating experiences, not just hardware
    

## The Whys of Up24 (Minimalist fitness tracker)

- Real-time feedback to track and achieve goals today, rather than try to do better tomorrow
    
- Understand my data in a more meaningful, timely way to make the value obvious
    
- I need guidance and structure on motivating activities to keep me going
    
- I want ongoing encouragement and validation
    
- I want a fluid/frictionless way to log activities, to never ‘miss’ a sleep
    

## Q&A

- How do you communicate or check for trade-offs across the company when you’re focusing on one vertical?
    

- When you start small it's easy
    
- When big, you have to force communication
    
- Everyone has to share their pains so you can balance priorities across different silos
    
- Always refer to the original vision board of the product
    
- Does the product still meet those requirements?
    

- If a startup wants to build an ecosystem, where to start?
    

- Almost everything we build is a system
    
- Even the standalone app is a system
    
- Still about trade-offs between verticals to get the best product
    

- How to decide when to expand?
    

- Some of it is planned
    
- NA > Europe > Asia
    
- Some of it is opportunistic
    

- Great partner
    
- Strong cultural fit
    
- Partnership with Apple store
    

- Manufacturing took place in China
    

- Gradually had their own Chinese team on the ground
    

- Do you run Jawbone like a hardware or software company?
    

- Merging both is difficult
    
- We’re not following any example model
    

- Likely not been done in this way before
    

- Trying to merge different disciplines is both fun and painful
    

- Need to cherry pick the best parts of both disciplines and come up with their own model of what works
    

# Chapter 16: Legal and Accounting for Startups (Kirsty Nathoo, Carolynn Levy)

- Boring but necessary to know the broad picture
    
- Will save a lot of pain, money
    

## Formation

- Keep it simple
    
- Form a separate legal entity to prevent personal liability
    
- Delaware is the best place to form corporations
    

- Standardised, clear, familiar
    

- How do you set that up?
    

- Fax paperwork to Delaware
    
- Sets up a shell company
    
- Everybody must have titles for CEO, president, secretary, etc.
    
- Be clear about the split between you and company as separate identities
    

- Can use law firms and online services
    

- YC uses Clerky to incorporate
    

- Keep signed documents in a safe place
    

- If big funding round, acquisition, THIS IS SUPER IMPORTANT
    

## Equity Allocation

- How to divide the pie?
    

- Ideas alone are worth nothing
    
- Execution is worth most of all
    
- Should probably be split equal among co founders
    

- Disproportionate split is a red flag
    
- Are founders not revealing any bad blood/ill feelings?
    
- Honesty about expectations for the future
    

- Look forward, not backwards
    

- Is everyone in it for the long haul?
    
- Everyone should be in it 100%
    
- Doesn’t matter about who did code, education, idea, etc.
    
- If moving forward, everyone is 100% committed, an even split is natural
    

- Even as a founder, you must attain your shares from the company (a separate entity) through a stock purchase agreement
    

- Two-way transaction
    
- Usually in the form of cash/stock payments over time in exchange for IP, code, inventions that the company now owns
    
- This stock is referred to as being restricted
    

- It vests over time
    

- Restricted stock involves a VERY VERY important document
    

- 83b election affects individual and company taxes
    
- Not doing this document properly can blow up deals
    
- Keep proof-of-submission or investors may walk away if the paperwork disappears
    

## Vesting

- Earning the personal ownership of the shares over time
    

- If you leave before the vesting period is over, the company will get unvested shares back
    

- What should a typical vesting period be?
    

- Standard in SV is 4 years with a 1 year cliff
    
- After 1 year, the founder owns 25% of his shares
    
- The remainder vest monthly over the next 3 years
    

- What happens when a founder leaves before vesting period is over?
    

- If founder leaves before a year, they get nothing
    
- If they leave after a year, company repurchases the remaining 75% at whatever share price the founder paid for it
    

- Why would you have vesting?
    

- Keeps founders committed to the company
    

- Should solo founders have vesting?
    

- Yes, skin in the game still applies
    
- If an investor is brought in, they will also have vesting
    
- Not fair that the founder has no vesting then
    

- Vesting sets the tone for the company - everyone is in this for the long haul
    

## Fundraising

- Two ways to raise money
    

- Priced or non-priced rounds
    

- Seed round = price not set
    
- Series X round = price set
    
- Non-priced rounds is the fastest way to get done
    

- Conducting through convertible notes or safes
    
- Basically a smart contract which dictates the amount of shares an investor receives at the end of a priced round
    
- Basically this investor is not yet a shareholder, and will have fundamentally different rights
    

- Investors at such an early round want something in return
    

- That’s where the valuation cap comes in
    
- For a seed round, an investor might come in at $100,000 at a 5 mil cap = 2% of the company
    
- At a later priced round, where the valuation of the company is set at 20 mil, original investor gets 20/5 = 4 times as many shares as a new investor at that round
    

- Can use Clerky again for fundraising docs
    
- Future dilution is something that founders must think about before giving away shares willy nilly
    
- Investors must be sophisticated
    

- Must have enough money to invest
    
- They must understand that startups is a risky investment
    
- “Accredited investors”
    
- Investors who want money back later is a problem
    

## Investor Terminology

- Board seat
    

- Sometimes investors will ask for a seat on the board
    
- Most of the time you want to say no
    
- Be very sure the investor is someone who brings a lot of value to the table
    
- If someone can help with strategy and direction for real, that’s priceless
    

- Advisors
    

- So many people want to give advice, but few give good stuff
    
- All investors should be advisors by default, with no additional returns
    
- If they’re already invested in the company, they should want it to do well
    
- Asking for more shares/money is a red flag
    

- Pro rata rights
    

- The right to maintain your % ownership by buying more shares in the company in the future
    
- Allows one to prevent dilution on their own shares in the company
    
- A common request from investors, not necessarily a bad thing
    
- As a founder, you MUST know how this works
    
- Key insight: for an investor to maintain pro-rata right, it means the founders likely have to suffer more dilution
    

- Information rights
    

- Investors want rights to know information about your company
    
- Periodic updates to investors is a good thing
    
- Avenue to ask for help from investors on hiring, advice, etc.
    
- But be careful when investors demand things like monthly budget reports, weekly updates, not okay
    

## Expenses

- Business expenses
    

- Cost of carrying out business
    

- Hosting
    
- Rent
    
- Salaries
    

- Important for logging on company tax returns
    

- Reduces tax that company pays
    

- Non-business expenses incurred by the company actually increase the taxes the company has to pay
    

- Investors gave a lot of money, and they want to see that money make the co succeed
    

- Make sure what you spend on business expenses are indeed for the business
    
- Difficult to separate this in the early stages, when your office is your house, etc.
    

- Bookkeeping is important
    

- Keep all your receipts
    
- When you eventually engage a bookkeeper, all these receipts are important
    

## Wages and Firing

- Founder Employment
    

- Founders are employees of the company and must be paid wages
    
- Minimum wage is advised
    

- Companies must pay payroll taxes
    

- Setting up payroll service is worth spending money on
    
- Companies have blew up by avoiding payroll taxes
    

- Founder Breakups
    

- Paying all founders is important
    
- If one founder leaves, he/she may use a lack of wages as leverage to get more money for leaving
    
- This is typically in the form of vesting acceleration
    
- AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS
    

## Hiring Employees

- Is the new hire an employee or contractor?
    

- Both sign documents that assign IP they create to the company
    
- Contractors set their own hours
    

- Given a clear project and end result
    
- Use their own equipment
    
- No say in day-to-day dealings
    
- Taxes are the responsibility of the individual
    
- Company will give 1099 document to the contractor which they will use for personal tax returns
    

- Employee 
    

- Companies responsible for taxes
    
- Receives a W2 form for personal tax returns
    
- Need to be paid minimum wage
    
- Workers Compensation Insurance is important to prevent fines
    
- Proof of work in the USA
    

- You must use a payroll service provider to handle complex payroll for you
    

- Zenpayroll is one good service
    

## Firing Employees

- Firing is hard
    

- Requires a founder to do what is right, not what is easy
    

- Fire fast
    

- Do not put off the difficult conversation
    
- Don’t let the bad employee linger
    
- May make good employees quit
    

- Communicate effectively
    

- Make clear direct statements
    
- Don’t make excuses
    
- Don’t apologise
    
- Face to face with a third party present

- Cut-off access to digital systems ASAP
    
- Repurchase unvested stock
    

## Biggest Takeaways

- Be fair and forward-looking about equity ownership. VEST
    
- Stock doesn’t buy itself
    
- Be savvy about financing documents
    
- Founders must get paid
    
- Employees must sign docs to assign IP to company
    
- Fire quickly and professionally
    
- Know your key metrics
    

- Cash position, burn rate, runway
    

- Follow the rules and take it seriously
    

## Q&A

- How to search for accountant and when?
    

- Bookkeeper vs. CPA/accountant
    

- Bookkeepers handle receipts and expenses
    
- CPA handles ANNUAL tax returns
    

- Probably okay for founders in the early days to do this themselves
    
- But best to engage a service like indinero to handle this
    

- Not worth a founder’s time to figure this shit out
    

- Look for CPA/bookkeeper/lawyers via reference
    

- Make sure they specialise in startups
    

- What about fees and legal council?
    

- Incorporation can be done for cheap online, without a lawyer
    
- Use Clerky to handle most standardised fundraising/incorporation things
    

- What about crypto & equity?
    

- Banks will struggle to deal with this
    
- No general advice, it’s product specific
    

# Chapter 17: Sales and Marketing; How to Talk to Investors (Tyler Bosmeny @ Clever, YC Partners)

- People think about building a great product first, and then hiring the sales people after
    
- Truth is that the salesperson is YOU
    

- Build or sell - nothing else matters
    
- Pick a founder to own this completely
    
- Founder passion trumps sales experience

- ![](../03%20-%20MEDIA%20&%20FILES/c2904ef3ac840116f167ef9200da9bad_MD5.png)
    

### Conversations

- Now that you’re on the phone:
    

- TALK LESS
    
- Let the customer speak (70%)
    
- Ask good questions to understand their problem?
    

- Why did you agree to take my call?
    
- How do you currently solve this problem?
    
- What would your ideal solution look like?
    

- Follow-up religiously
    

- Even with perfect customers, there will be many no-replies
    
- Especially with high-profile busy customers
    
- Drive things to closure in an inhuman, unreasonable way
    

- Get people to a yes or no as quickly as you can
    

### Closing

- YC has standard agreement templates
    
- Remember your goals
    

- Get customers
    
- Get validation
    
- Get revenue
    

- Common traps
    

- Redlining
    

- Don’t quibble over minor points
    
- Keep your ego out of the way
    

- 1 more feature
    

- Sometimes customers will say, ‘I’d use your product, but it’s missing one feature’
    
- First reaction is to promise to build that feature for them
    
- But the reality is that companies will rarely follow up on that promise
    
- Avoid building one thing for one customer
    
- Either:
    

- Sign a conditional agreement in writing
    
- Or wait to hear more demand from more customers (if this is really worth building)
    

- Free trials
    

- This is a reasonable request, BUT
    
- Early on, you need revenue, commitment and validation
    
- People will usually flake out
    
- Offer an annual contract with a cancellation period after delivery
    

### Revenue

- 5 ways to build a big business
    

- ![](../03%20-%20MEDIA%20&%20FILES/9edbd3276be5c0ca78942102d436bff5_MD5.png)
    
- Flea/mice/rabbits rely on marketing
    
- Deer rely on inside sales
    
- Elephants rely on field sales
    

- Price your product carefully to fall into the category that you want
    

- If you’re a rabbit and charge 1000/year, flying out to see that customer for demos, setup, presentations will NOT BE WORTH IT

## Talking to Investors

- The best way to make your pitch better is to make your company better
    

### Before Meeting

- How to pitch?
    

- 30 second pitch
    

- What does your company do?
    

- Assume audience knows nothing
    
- One sentence mom test, simple language
    

- How big is the market?
    

- Do some research, not difficult to get
    

- How much traction do you have?
    

- ‘We launched in Jan, growing 30% month on month”
    
- If no customers, convince investor that you’re working quickly
    
- ‘Started work in Jan, beta in March, launch by next month’
    

- 2 minute pitch
    

- 30s pitch
    
- Unique insight
    

- Opportunity to tell audience something they didn’t know
    
- Something the big players don’t understand
    
- Aha moment! Watch for this expression
    
- Crystallise to 2 sentences
    

- How you make money
    

- Business model
    
- One sentence long, make sure it’s clear and stand by it
    

- Team
    

- If someone has done something impressive, call that out
    
- Don’t ramble on awards, phds, whatever
    
- Focus on how many founders, how many technical, how many business, how long have you known each other
    
- Everyone working full-time
    
- How you met
    

- ASK FOR MONEY
    

- Convertible note? Safe? What’s the cap?
    
- How much are you asking for?
    
- Minimum check size
    

- When to fundraise?
    

- Investors like traction
    
- Unfortunately, you will be in a situation where you won’t have much traction
    

- SInce you’re the one asking for money, they are strong, you are weak
    
- How do you flip the equation?
    
- You want a situation where investors WANT to give you money
    

- You are strong, they are weak
    
- Good time to start fundraising
    

- To create a situation where people want to fund you, you need to:
    
- Spread the word
    

- Press
    
- Friends
    

- Plan such that you don’t need much funds to grow
    

- 95% of startups can bring product to market with very little money
    
- Take the mindset of, “we’re all on this train that’s leaving the station. If you wanna invest, great. If not, we have other options”
    

- Always be able to show you have a committed team that’s working fast
    

- How to setup investor meetings
    

- Warm intros are best
    

- Previous founders
    
- Referrals from other investors are so-so
    

- Think in parallel
    

- Fundraising is a sprint
    
- Line up all your meetings in a single week
    
- “Hey we’re in build mode for the next 2 weeks. Can we do a meeting 3 weeks from now?”
    

- Gives you buffer time to line everyone up then
    
- Hints that you’re not desperate - we’re busy
    

- Fundraising should be something one person takes charge of
    

- Don’t distract the whole company
    

### During Meeting

- Bad Example
    

- Make sure the listener understands what you’re talking about
    
- Know your numbers
    
- Tell your market-size through a bottom-up analysis - don’t just name drop big companies
    
- Understand something that is counter-intuitive
    
- Team should be uniquely suited to this business
    
- Drive the conversation to a conclusion
    

- Good Example
    

- Capture interest, told an interesting story, engage with listener
    
- Demonstrate insights and command of the market with passion, not intellectual dismissiveness
    
- Collaborative meeting - not a 1-1 interview
    
- Asked for money with details and such
    
- Drove to a close
    

- We’re closing the round, these are our other backers, etc.
    

### After Meeting

- Follow up!
    

- Anything other than check is a no
    

- Work on creating demand (supply/demand)
    

- Say that there are other people in the round
    
- “Mike is willing to fill up the round, but we want to bring you on”
    

- Do diligence on the investors
    

- Be very careful who you’re selling to
    

- Know when to stop fundraising
    

- Don’t get addicted to it
    

- Build your company properly (fundraising is not the goal)

- Some process/framework is necessary for product dev, but don’t let it be the main driver
    
- Ship everyday
    

- Continued focus on delivery
    

- Have transparency and rhythm in communication
    

- Weekly management meetings
    
- All-hands meetings
