## tl;dr

**This project will have you write content on your very own website for free in no time!**

The goal of *poko* is to make it effortless to publish content on the web on your own terms. Replace complex CMSes, proprietary website builders, social media accounts, â€¦ with a simple workflow: **write** + **click "publish"**.

### What you get:

-   A 100% **free website** / blog / [digital garden](https://ryan.warner.codes/what-is-a-digital-garden/) you own
    
-   An 'almost [**WYSIWYG**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG)' experience
    
-   A very **low friction writing** and publishing experience
    
-   A static website: **modern**, fast, lightweight, **eco-friendly**, very secure, that requires **zero maintenance**
    
-   A deeply **expandable platform** based on a rich ecosystem of tools with practically no limits to the functionalities or design you would want to implement
    

> ðŸ“Œ *poko* is in early **Alpha**. It is incomplete and things may change or break unexpectedly. The sooner you join, the more you should be prepared for a rocky ride. Our advice: **join now** but don't customize too much. In any case, your website being static, it is often very easy to roll your website back to a previous working version if something breaks.
