As of today, what worked was:

1.  Uninstall WeMod if you have it installed. Clean the <user>/AppData/Local/WeMod & <user>/AppData/Roaming/WeMod directories.
    
2.  I also ran CCleaner to clean up registry but don't know if it helped.
    
3.  Download an older version of WeMod from [https://www.wingetgui.com/apps/WeMod-WeMod/8-2-0](https://www.wingetgui.com/apps/WeMod-WeMod/8-2-0)
    
4.  Install it and prevent it from updating by immediately closing it when it tries to update
    
5.  Go to <user>/AppData/Local/WeMod and rename Update.exe to Update1.exe for e.g.
    
6.  Download zip from [https://sharemods.com/gg9zios3hjxy/WeMod\_Premium.zip.html](https://sharemods.com/gg9zios3hjxy/WeMod_Premium.zip.html)
    
7.  This zip is completely safe and contains the app.asar file.
    
8.  Copy this app.asar file to <user>/AppData/Local/WeMod/app-8.2.0/resources folder and replace the existing app.asar file there.
    
9.  Run WeMod, login (using a temporary email is suggested for safety) and enjoy premium.
    

Edit: if you change your username or anything else in wemod, the premium will be gone but simply copy app.asar file again after quitting wemod and get back the premium.

Edit2: There are some links to files in other comments on this post which were good to use before but now contain a lot of trojans/viruses. Be careful! I wasn't and am now dealing with hacked accounts.

You need to download the .exe not install it with the command line.

Worked fine following this guide. Thanks bud.

Same as the other one, when you close WeMod when it tries to update and rename the update file, WeMod won't open.

it says that it needs an internet connection to launch for the first time

Apparently u can only run the 8.2.0 version, if you do this in the latest(9.7.0) version, it will not run. Just go to app-8.2.0 folder then run WeMod.exe there, it should be on pro.

also doesn't work, if I rename the update exe, WeMod can't run

No need to rename the update.exe. Just after step 9, wemod should open but it says you are not on pro, just close it then navigate to <user>/AppData/Local/WeMod/app-8.2.0 then run WeMod.exe.
