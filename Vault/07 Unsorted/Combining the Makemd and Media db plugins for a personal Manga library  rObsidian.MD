[Make.md](https://www.make.md/) is a plugin that makes your notes and folders more interactive and visual. The [Media db plugin](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-media-db-plugin) is a great tool to add metadata to books, movies, gamesâ€¦ and also manga (through an API that gets the data from MyAnimeList). In the settings you can adjust the template and what kind of metadata you want. I changed the cover property to banner, so it displays the imageUrl as a banner. Combine this with the visual functionality of Make.md and you got yourself a beautiful and fully customisable personal library.
