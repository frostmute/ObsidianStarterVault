A downloadable frontend for Windows

[Download Now](https://retrobatofficial.itch.io/retrobat/purchase)Name your own price

RetroBat is a software distribution project designed to automatically configure EmulationStation‚Äôs frontend interface with the well-known multi-emulator RetroArch and with many others standalone emulators.

With it you will be able to quickly run games from many compatible ROM collections. This saves hours of configuration and installation time, leaving you free to play your favourite retro games.

RetroBat automatically downloads and installs all the relevant software needed to have the best retro gaming experience on your Windows PC.

RetroBat is made with "portability" in mind. This means you can play games from an external hard drive or from any removable storage device, as long as the used computer meets the minimum requirements.

***Ô∏è‚É£Important notice**

**RetroBat doesn't provide any unauthorized¬†commercial or copyrighted games. It is packed only with few free homebrew games. You need to add yourself the games and roms you own in the dedicated directories. You can use the built-in Content downloader to download demo and homebrew games directly from the interface.**  
  
If you need help, please to not use the comments section below but instead our Discord Server or Forum. Thank you.

**ü¶á Features**

- **EmulationStation Frontend** in a special version with¬†a lot of options. A light, fast and customizable interface,¬†XML themes creation with animations capabilities.

- **Scrape Medias** (box art, marquee, artwork, manual, etc) to pimp your game collection.

- **150+ Systems** already configured. You just need to add your own games. RetroBat doesn't bring unauthorized content of copyrighted software.

- **Create Themed Collections**. Sort your game by genre or by everything you want.

- **Content Downloader**. Download emulators, themes, homebrews, demos, bezels, directly from the interface.

- **Deep Integration**. No need to get lost in a multitude of software. All major emulators options are directly integrated within the main interface. You can choose options globally, per systems or per games.

- **Integrated Updater**. Receive notifications when a new version of an emulator is available. The developpers of RetroBat spend hours to test emulators to give you the best stable experience. You will also receive a notification when a new version of RetroBat is released.

Hi, RetroBat Setup doesn't include games metadata. You can use internal scraper such as ScreenScraper to scrape metadata for your games library.

Hello  
Yes, you can update, but you can do it directly from the Retrobat menu.

I'd rather just use the retroarch app. Its way easier and understandable.¬† It also doesn't start up with a generic 2014 youtube intro with the application name in it. And its also easier to uninstall, rather than retrobat. Retrobat does not have a uninstall file so you can't uninstall it through the control center or manually find the uninstall file in the file location; because it's not there:/

  

Edit: it also takes up 2 gigs on ur hard drive, which either I missed, or they weren't very clear about.

Hi, it seems that RetroBat is not for what you need. You didn't need an uninstall program because you just have to delete your RetroBat folder to "uninstall" it. RetroBat is totally portable. RetroBat allow you to launch intro video, but you can set up which video you want, or completely disable it. It take more space than just retroarch because it provide more than only one emulator...

Hello,

it takes 2 gigabyte because it includes retroarch, shaders, and additional emulators.

It is a portable application, so it does not need to be uninstalled, as it is not even "installed" in the first place !

respectfully disagree, with setting up retroarch on multiple platforms it's tedious and cumbersome the actual menus, the drag and drop nature of retrobat and I'll give a mention to retrodeck too is a godsend. More time playing games, less time configuring.

Shortcuts PDF is confusing.

Can you tell me the shortcuts on ROG Ally.

- I want to know the shortcuts for going to the Retrobat Menu from the game. I'm able to do this using the select and start buttons in EmuDeck, and I want to know how I can do this in RetroBat.

- And also what about remapping the controls to say the keyboard keys or gamepad keys? Especially for DOS games. DOS games don't seem to be added to the library and I've no idea.

Edit: I don't know what to set the hotkey to since I don't have additional buttons on the ROG Ally. Also the RetroBat user manual has confusing hotkey pics. I don't have the back ish button on my ally and I have no idea what I'm supposed to press.  

- Or even remapping two buttons so that both buttons simulate one of the buttons. For example in Mario I could remap R1 or L1 to the Fireflower-fire so that running becomes easier than pressing X and A at the same time.

Hello,

To turn off the music you need to launch RetroBat, display the main menu, and go to the sounds options.

You can run retrobat in windowed mode, just run the "batgui.exe" tool located in the same folder as Retrobat executable, and tick the option there to disable fullscreen.

Hi. RetroBat is a free project, you didn't buy it, you made a donation. The full setup program is a reward for those who donate to the project. The main purpose of RetroBat isn't to provide games, but being a retrogaming software distribution dedicated to emulation, so basically an already configured frontend with a advanced integration of the emulators options. You need to provide yourself the games. Please read carefully the description and the different posts before giving money.¬† If you think that it's a misunderstanding, you can ask for a refund.

Hello, thank you for your donation. You didn‚Äôt bought RetroBat, you give a free price. Full 5.1.1 setup is kind of a reward for those how donate to the project. For issue, if you need support it could be better to go on our forum or on our Discord. First thing, make sure your computer meets the minimum requirements and you followed the setup instructions. Make sure you have DirectX and the VC++ Redistributable installed.
