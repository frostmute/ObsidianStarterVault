- Trump proposed $5.7 billion
- Shutdown ended without any finalized agreement on border wall funding, putting 800,000 federal workers out of work for no reason.

- Trans-discrimination in schools: [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/upshot/transgender-rights-trump.html](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/upshot/transgender-rights-trump.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1716689795913873&usg=AOvVaw0adZ1gaFRcBg-ibfIh9Jug)

- A New York Times investigation of the [opportunity zones] program last November found “the Trump administration’s signature plan to lift [cities] — a multibillion-dollar tax break that is supposed to help low-income areas — has fueled a wave of developments financed by and built for the wealthiest Americans.” The article spotlighted luxury developments backed by big celebrity developers and help for projects already in the works
- Trump claims that they have created “countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment,” but there is no proof of that $100 billion, the closest figure is $47 billion as a projected number in the coming years, not the current spending.
- Urban Institute states, “Although opportunity zones were designed to spur job creation, the vast majority of opportunity zones capital appears to be flowing into real estate, not into operating businesses.” That’s contrary to Trump’s claim that the program has created “countless jobs.”

- Trump signed executive order to roll back Obama era restrictions on the transfer of military equipment to local PDs: “Obama also signed an executive order to create a working group to limit surplus military equipment and supplies that are provided for free to state and local law enforcement agencies under what’s called the 1033 program...tracked armored vehicles, grenade launchers and firearms/ammunition of .50 caliber and above — and a “controlled equipment list” — including wheeled armored vehicles, riot shields and helmets, and explosives. Police departments could still obtain the equipment in the latter group, but they would have to provide justification for needing it and proper training”
- Obama-era effort: the Collaborative Reform Initiative in the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, which worked with local law enforcement to evaluate their operations, and recommend and institute changes. That program, too, ended under Trump.
- Trump's executive order parallels Obama’s 2015 executive order that he trashed, the Task Force on 21st Century Policing: Trump’s executive order called for the attorney general and secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to “develop opportunities to train law enforcement officers with respect to encounters with individuals suffering from impaired mental health, homelessness, and addiction” and “to increase the capacity of social workers working directly with law enforcement agencies.” The 2015 task force report recommended “multidisciplinary, community team approaches” for “responding to mental health crisis situations” as well as community problems involving “homelessness, substance abuse, domestic violence, human trafficking, and child abuse.”

- Trump is proposing a rule allowing federally funded homeless shelters to turn away trans and gender non-conforming people, revoking 2015 Affirmatively Furthering Fair housing rule by Obama admin.

- Rolled back 50 year old National Environmental Policy Act. Major infrastructure projects like pipelines and highways could be exempt from environmental reviews.

- Promised 5% GDP growth and it only grew 2.9%

- Obama has better GDP growth in last 2 years than trumps first 2 years

- GDP dropped 9.5% in July 2020 (the second quarter)

- the biggest decrease in GDP on record, shrinking $1.8 trillion in the 2nd quarter ([https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/business/economy/q2-gdp-coronavirus-economy.html](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/business/economy/q2-gdp-coronavirus-economy.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1716689795918611&usg=AOvVaw04NXfkhdvf5HacQW-Jf4o8))

- 20% of $2.3 trillion tax cuts went to wealthiest 1% who saw $62,000/year tax cut, middle ⅕ of income earners saw a $1,000/year tax cut
- When the law is fully in effect in 8 years, 83% of cuts go to top 1%
- This trickle down economics policy has not worked, as large corporations that saw tax cuts didn’t spend it on wages, but rather on billions in stock buybacks (buying of stock to increase its price)

- Buybacks totaled $579 billion for the first three quarters of 2018 and are expected to smash the previous annual record of $589 billion, set in 2007.

- “More U.S. coal-fired power plants were shut in President Donald Trump’s first two years than were retired in the whole of Barack Obama’s first term, despite the Republican’s efforts to prop up the industry to keep a campaign promise to coal-mining states.”

- Trump did not invent the idea of giving veterans the option to see private doctors outside the Department of Veterans Affairs medical system at government expense. Congress approved the private-sector Veterans Choice health program in 2014 and Obama signed it into law. Trump expanded it.
- VA does not expect Trump’s expansion to increase the number of people in care because the private sector has longer wait times.

- Millions of unspent money: [https://time.com/5483823/veterans-affairs-suicide-prevention/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://time.com/5483823/veterans-affairs-suicide-prevention/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1716689795921567&usg=AOvVaw2jWl0x9-ZXJMBkXPPSxQLh)

- Pay raises in quantity for military actually shrunk under Trump (3.4% under Obama to 2.6% at its highest under Trump)

- Transgender in military ban: [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/us/politics/trump-transgender-military.html](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/us/politics/trump-transgender-military.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1716689795922071&usg=AOvVaw2rNnZHQF7Ld_wZqjA9_bgC)

- “Some 2,000 to 11,000 active-duty troops are transgender, according to a 2016 RAND Corporation study commissioned by the Pentagon, though estimates of the number of transgender service members have varied widely, and are sometimes as high as 15,000.”
- “The study found that allowing transgender people to serve openly in the military would “have minimal impact on readiness and health care costs” for the Pentagon. It estimated that health care costs would rise $2.4 million to $8.4 million a year, representing an infinitesimal 0.04 to 0.13 percent increase in spending.”

- American troops killed by Taliban after being given military equipment and financial aid by Russia.

- By repealing ACA, Medicare beneficiaries would pay more because premiums and deductibles are tied to the growth of federal outlays (expenditures): [https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/what-are-the-implications-of-repealing-the-affordable-care-act-for-medicare-spending-and-beneficiaries/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/what-are-the-implications-of-repealing-the-affordable-care-act-for-medicare-spending-and-beneficiaries/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1716689795923183&usg=AOvVaw2nF2PnmAtL3JnI64ae5jJ2)

- The Congressional Budget Office estimates that “full repeal of the ACA would increase Medicare spending by $802 billion from 2016 to 2025. Full repeal would increase spending primarily by restoring higher payments to health care providers and Medicare Advantage plans. The increase in Medicare spending would likely lead to higher Medicare premiums, deductibles, and cost sharing for beneficiaries, and accelerate the insolvency of the Medicare Part A trust fund.”
