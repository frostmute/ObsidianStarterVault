There are dozens of videos on tasks, with jumps and tricks, but this one is a journey! It's very well put together, yet simple. No questions left, no gaps, no bells, just pure logical options. What a joy (for a very tech experienced guy). Unquestionable like and subscribe, kudos and thanks!

LOVE these "full walkthough" videos you do for plugins

This is the best video about this plugin, by far! As a Brazilian and a newbie to Obsidian, I've been trying to understand how to use this plugin and set a GTD system on Obsidian and your video is the one that saved me! Thanks a lot!

Danny, thanks so much for taking the time to do this. I have been using Tasks for quite a while but missed the new dependency abilities and the CSS for displaying backlinks as a single character is great.

The best and most complete tutorial on Obsidian about tasks!!!!

I've been playing with Obsidian for a few weeks, it has a learning curve, but I believe it is worth it as it will allow me to centralize all my notes, projects, and to-do lists. Danny this video is epic. Now I can get rid of Todoist (which has been plaguing my google calendar with stuff) and be able to run all my to do lists exactly as I want. This whole concept of Obsidian is totally sick. Even adding external .md docs from the outside into the appropriate folders get digested.

I'm using metadata menu right now for my tasks. I have a task fileClass with a number of properties including status.

Yeah, I needed this to love even more obsidian, obsessidian

When I reached the point where a single toDo had multiple dates and a priority added my brain just shut down, lol …This vid is going to take all weekend for me to process. Thank you for making this though, it's great info and it really helps.

Thank you for sharing the hot key thing, I have been hating making the tasks manually. I didn't realize it was "checkbox"

… and there was light … in my head ! Thanks

Thx Danny. This plugin is insanely powerful. Great timing for me. I was thinking about to giving up on Todoist and going with Tasks plugin. Tasks plugin Dependency style is weak, do not find functional. Chain few tasks (with Statuses) can be good. But need visual improvement. May be like recurring tasks. When I finish 1/5 step, that step should be finished and show me next 2/5 step above/below. Also I had an issue with Autosuggest function because I use Various Complements plugin. Solution: Adding a suppress trigger in Various Complements plugin options for lines that start with checkboxes. (- \[ \]\*) Todoist is very clean and smooth. I will try both for a while and decide later.

Thanks for such a thorough treatment, really useful reference :)

Superb video. Thanks so much!

Thanks @DannyHatcherTech for making this video. Can you please let me know which calendar plugin you have used in the video or is it morgen. How are your tasks getting synched on morgen calendar?

Thanks for the explanation! What plugin do you use for the calendar?

Do you still use morgen tasks or have you switched to Obsidian tasks? Or is this just an overview of the plugin and you are still using Morgen tasks?
