Lyle the Therapy Gecko started as a kind of accident. The pandemic hit, and like most of us, Lyle found himself in his mom’s basement, laid off from his job, and spending too much time online. After a few too many nights on Reddit’s streaming platform, Lyle put on a gecko costume and decided to stream himself. Suddenly, the views and calls started pouring in- and so did people's problems. Lyle found himself in a new predicament, alone in a basement acting as a therapist to the masses. In this Episode of My Life Online, we unmask the man behind the costume.
