## Everything

## What is "Everything"?

"Everything" is search engine that locates files and folders by filename instantly for Windows.

Unlike Windows search "Everything" initially displays every file and folder on your computer (hence the name "Everything").

You type in a search filter to limit what files and folders are displayed.

  

## How long will it take to index my files?

"Everything" only indexes file and folder names and generally takes a few seconds to build its database.

A fresh install of Windows 10 (about 120,000 files) will take about 1 second to index.

1,000,000 files will take about 1 minute.

  

## Does Everything search file contents?

Yes, "Everything" can search file content with the content: search function.

File content is not indexed, searching content is slow.

  

## Does "Everything" hog my system resources?

No, "Everything" uses very little system resources.

A fresh install of Windows 10 (about 120,000 files) will use about 14 MB of ram and less than 9 MB of disk space.

1,000,000 files will use about 75 MB of ram and 45 MB of disk space.

  

## Does "Everything" monitor file system changes?

Yes, "Everything" does monitor your file systems for all changes.

Your search results will update in real-time to reflect any changes.

Everything will automatically keep your NTFS indexes up to date with the NTFS USN Journal.

Changes will not be missed when Everything is not running as the system maintains the NTFS USN Journal.

  

## Is "Everything" free?

Yes, "Everything" is Freeware.

Please consider [donating](https://www.voidtools.com/donate).

  

## Does "Everything" contain any malware, spyware or adware?

No, "Everything" does not contain any malware, spyware or adware.

  

## Does "Everything" miss changes made to the file system if it is not running?

No, "Everything" can be closed and restarted without missing changes made to the file system (even across system restarts).

"Everything" updates the database when it is started.

  

## What are the system requirements for "Everything"?

"Everything" will run on Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10 and Windows 11.

NTFS indexing requires the Everything service or running "Everything" as administrator.

  

## What is the Lite version of "Everything"?

The Lite version of Everything is the same as the normal multilingual version of Everything, except it has some features removed:

  

- Removed [ETP/FTP Server](https://www.voidtools.com/support/everything/etp).
- Removed [HTTP Server](https://www.voidtools.com/support/everything/http).
- Removed [IPC](https://www.voidtools.com/support/everything/sdk/ipc).

The Command line interface / ES will not work with the Lite version.

The SDK will not work with the Lite version.

Windows accessibility features and screen readers will not work with the Lite version.

  

## How do I index a FAT volume?

To add a FAT, FAT32 or exFAT volume to your Everything index:

- In ***"Everything"***, from the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.
- Click the **Folders** tab on the left.
- Click **Add...**.
- Select your **FAT volume** and click **OK**.
- Click **OK**.

  

To add a mapped network drive/NAS/Network share to your Everything index:

- In ***"Everything"***, from the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.
- Click the **Folders** tab on the left.
- Click **Add...**.
- Select the **mapped network drive/NAS/Network share** and click **OK**.
- Click **OK**.

If network drive is not listed in Everything, please try running Everything as a standard user:

- In ***"Everything"***, from the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.
- Click the **General** tab on the left.
- Check **Everything service**.
- Uncheck **Run as administrator**.
- Click **OK**.
- **Restart** ***"Everything"*** (right click the Everything tray icon and click Exit).

  

## How do I convert a volume to NTFS?

Please backup anything important before converting a volume to NTFS.

Once a volume is converted to NTFS it can not be converted back to FAT, FAT32 or exFAT without reformatting.

Please note that some devices may not be able to read NTFS volumes on USB disks / USB drives.

To convert a volume to NTFS:

- From the **Start** menu, search for: **cmd**
- Click **Command Prompt**.
- In the command prompt, type in the following and press **ENTER**:

```
convert D: /fs:ntfs
```

*where D: is the drive to convert.*

  

## How do I install "Everything"?

Please see A [basic guide to installing "Everything"](https://www.voidtools.com/support/everything/installing_everything).

  

## How do I use "Everything"?

Please see A [basic guide to using "Everything"](https://www.voidtools.com/support/everything/using_everything).

  

## Why is "Everything" 1.4 using more memory than 1.3?

"Everything" 1.4 indexes file sizes and dates and also stores extra information for faster sorting by default.

Please see [Optimizing for smallest memory foot print](https://www.voidtools.com/support/everything/indexes#optimizing_for_smallest_memory_foot_print) to disable these changes.

  

## How do I prevent the UAC prompt when running "Everything"?

"Everything" requires administrative privileges for low level read access to NTFS volumes for NTFS indexing.

The UAC (User Account Control) prompt can be avoided by running "Everything" as a standard user and installing the "Everything" service or not using NTFS indexing.

To run "Everything" as a standard user and install the "Everything" service:

- In ***"Everything"***, from the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.
- Click the **General** tab.
- Check **Everything Service**.
- Uncheck **Run as administrator**.
- Click **OK**.
- **Exit *"Everything"*** (right click the Everything system tray icon and click Exit)
- **Restart *"Everything"***.

## Searching

  

## How do I search for a file or folder?

Type the partial file or folder name into the search edit, the results will appear instantly.

  

## How do I use boolean operators?

**AND** is the default boolean operator.

For example, to search for abc and 123, search for:

```
abc 123
```

To search for either of two search terms, add a | between the terms.

For example, to search for .jpg or .bmp, search for:

```
.jpg | .bmp
```

To exclude something from the search include a ! at the front of the term.

For example, to search for everything except abc, search for:

```
!abc
```

To show the basic search syntax in Everything:

- In ***"Everything"***, from the **Help** menu, click **Search syntax**.

  

## How do I use wildcards?

Using a \* in your search will match any number of any type of character.

For example, here is how to search for files and folders that start with e and end with g: e\*g

Using a ? in your search will match one character.

For example, here is how to search for files that have a 2 letter file extension: \*.??

  

## How do I include spaces in my search?

To include spaces in your search enclose your search in double quotes.

For example, here is how to search for foo<space>bar: "foo bar"

  

## How do I search for a file type?

To search for a file type, type the file extension into the search edit,

eg: to search for the mp3 file type, type \*.mp3 into the search edit.

To search for more than one type of file type use a | to separate file types,

eg: \*.bmp|\*.jpg will search for files with the extension bmp or jpg.

  

## How do I search for files and folders in a specific location?

To search for files and folders in a specific location include a \\ in your search string.

For example, here is how to search for all your mp3s in a downloads folder: downloads\\ .mp3

You could alternately enable Match Path in the Search menu and include the location in your search string.

For example, here is how to search for all your avis in a downloads folder with Match Path enabled: downloads .avi

  

## Advanced searching

See [Advanced Search](https://www.voidtools.com/support/everything/searching/#advanced_search) for more information.
