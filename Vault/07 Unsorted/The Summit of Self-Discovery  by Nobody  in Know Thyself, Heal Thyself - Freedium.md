# The Summit of Self-Discovery | by Nobody | in Know Thyself, Heal Thyself - Freedium

> ## Excerpt
> A Journey to Inner Peace.

---
In the hush of dawn's first light, I began my ascent up the sacred Mount Sinai. Each step was a pilgrimage, a journey into the heart of understanding. The world below seemed to fade away as I climbed higher, leaving behind the concerns of the mundane world to seek the wisdom of the cosmos.

At the summit, I took a moment to relax and watch my breath, not just from the physical exertion but in order to be attentive and fully absorb the beauty that stretched before me.

And then, like a whisper on the breeze, I sensed the presence of Musa al-Ghazawi, my muse, a man of Islamic wisdom, standing beside me.

His presence carried an aura of serenity and knowledge that calmed the inner storms of my questioning heart. As we stood in silence, he turned to me and spoke softly, "My friend, you have embarked on a profound journey, not just up this mountain but into yourself. It is here, in this inner sanctum, that the true revelations often occur."

With that, he began to quote and explain the Quranic verses which speaks about fighting, verses which has always puzzled me, and that has been misunderstood by so many ignorant believers who spread violence and destruction in the name of "Islam" (which literally means 'peace and surrender').

```
"Fight in the way of Alla::
thouse [thoughts and emotions] who fight you,
but do not transgress. 
Indeed, Alla:: do:::: not like transgressors." 
(2:190)
```

Musa explained, "These words are not a call to physical warfare, as many have misunderstood them to be. Instead, they are a call to win our inner struggle, the battle against our own lower selves (nafs). We must fight our own ego, the anger, hatred, and prejudice that can cloud our heart. The true jihad is the struggle for self-improvement and inner peace."

```
"And kill [the dualities created by your ego] 
whenever you overtake them, 
and expel [dualities] from wherever they have expelled you,
and fitnah is worse than killing.

And do not fight [your dualities] at al-Masjid al- Haram
until they fight you there. 
But if [your thoughts and emotions] fight you, then kill them.
Such is the recompense of the disbelievers."
(2:191)
```

Musa continued, "This verse speaks of the expulsion of duality from our hearts and minds. It calls upon us to transcend the boundaries that separate us and to distance ourselves from thoughts and emotions that sow discord and chaos in our lives and in the world. Fitnah, a discordant view of reality, is worse than killing for fulfilling existential needs like hunger, for it can lead to unnecessary wars and destruction. The bliss of unity is the recompense for the one who disbelieve in concepts like 'me' and 'them'"

```
"But if they [your inner discorces] cease, 
then indeed, Alla:: is Love." 
(2:192)
```

He paused, emphasizing, "When we choose the path of peace and surrender, we are aligning ourselves with Alla::'s attributes of love."

```
"Fight them [your dualities] until there is no fitnah [discord] 
and worship is for Alla:: [oness].
But if they [your discord] cease, 
then there is to be no aggression 
except against your oppressors." 
(2:193)
```

Musa concluded, "Here, my friend, is the culmination of these teachings. We are called to fight against our Fitnah — our inner discord, until peace and divinity is acknowledged in all aspects of our life. This fight is not against others but against the duality within us and the forces that seek to disrupt harmony in our world. And when our inner adversaries cease their aggression, our peaceful state of mind would be reflected by our non-aggressive actions, with the exception of self defense for our lives".

As I absorbed Musa's words, I realized that the turmoils I felt due to the recent Israeli-Arab fights were not about the battles between external foes, but a struggle to embrace my own divinity, an the inner existential struggle of being able to share the boundless love that flows from my inner core to every living creature affected by this geopolitical \[i.e. conceptual\] conflict.

The mountaintop, once a physical summit, had become a spiritual zenith where I understood that Alla:: isn't a conceptual deity external to my own existence, but the inner source of love within [me](https://medium.com/post-now-ism) [\~~~>](https://medium.com/post-now-ism/love-and-inclusion-in-the-heart-of-sinai-db7e61e87d61)
