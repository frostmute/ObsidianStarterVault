[May 14](https://talk.tiddlywiki.org/t/open-discussion-building-a-wiki-for-student-notes/9824)

Folks,

I will be returning to formal studies in the near future, and would like to build a TiddlyWiki edition to support course notes and the related study activities. I am keen to develop it before I start studies to avoid using the tinkering to procrastinate.

-   This may also result in a community edition.

I am starting this discussion to solicit plugins and design approaches because I am confident a lot of people have done something similar and come up with solutions after using such a wiki.

Here are a few high level requirements;

-   Ability to build a subject or course based wiki with structured content before, during and after classes and online activities.
    -   The critical thing is easy access to tools and resources in real time.
-   Ability to ultimately combine all classes into a single wiki for a comprehensive resource. Eg combine glossary, and other dictionaries into one.
-   Help and support, or cheat sheets to help leverage installed tools.
    -   For example its all fine to have a footnotes tool but when you want to use it during note taking you may need help to look up its syntax etc… if you have not used it for time or learned it yet, especially since our edition will have a lot of features.
-   Although many features will be at their best on a desktop we need to keep it useful on mobiles and tablets. Although we can just have a subset of features available that are mobile friendly.
    -   This includes touch screens and size eg external core, for this and other cources.

I have many other detailed requirements and lots of resources I have already defined but I do not want to prejudice your replies, or make this first post too long.

Well [My maths notebook 14](https://talk.tiddlywiki.org/t/my-maths-notebook/4917) was a stab at that which I never have the confidence to push on my students or the time to refine!

I’m guessing bibliography and reference plugins would be usefull?

Do you want cheat sheets to be created automatically? My experiance suggests these have to be crafted, though reuse of existing tiddlers in a new cheat sheet context can aid the process.

Ah… I misread. Your cheat sheets are for the wiki itself! That seems doable!

You say ‘combining’, are you thinking inital separate repositories of knowledge to be combined in a final end of term tomb?

Yes, basically documenting the plugins, and tools installed to assist with study notes, and ideally where the information is needed such as in the editor toolbar, or menu etc…

-   Some time the hardest part is giving enough information so the installed features are made use of, and habits developed.

Let say I spend a year in training doing multiple subjects, I think there is value in having a wiki per subject, but once completed, it makes sense to bring them together into a single wiki to search all past learnings.

-   Combining multiple subjects into the course that they belong.

I agree with you that procrastination and tinkering are potential problems, not only for functionality, but also regarding *structure*.

One challenge is that classes/lectures and reading often are *linear* activities, and the *non-linear* nature of TiddlyWiki can be distracting. Say you are studying art and have a lecture on Italian Baroque paintings - how should one organize the material *as a student*? Make a tiddler for each artist? Each technique? What if there a certain facts that you know are important - or details that are less important but useful to keep - how to highlight them? Separate tiddlers or just styling? What title to give them (`Caravaggio`/`Tenebrism`, `Painters/Caravaggio`/`Styles/Tenebrism`, `Lectures/2024-05-16/Caravaggio`)?

What I imagine would be a nice solution is if you were able to go to class and make a tiddler that looks something like this:

</code>
```

And later query those tiddlers for the summaries, important facts and flashcards. One strategy is to split the tiddler into subtiddlers. Another strategy is to use CSS to show/hide text (e.g., `display: none;` for everything that is not a summary).

I would also suggest to include a plugin to preview tiddler contents when hovering a link, and perhaps the reading mode plugin and a TOC plugin. Furthermore, having a nice stylesheet for printing (or saving as PDF) may be useful

Best,  
Anders

Ah yes, the Picasso Prevention Rule lol

given TW’s design, I’d probably go with using journals as your note pages, and then tagging based on the subject, and backlinks connect to relevent topics, such as artists, terms, etc.

IE say I was about to attend Spanish 101, I would create a new journal that would be titled “Spanish 101 - DATE” or something akin to that, and tag it “Notes” “Spanish 101”

Now you have all of your notes under the single tag of Notes, and all the ones specific to Spanish 101 under another tag. Give’s a nice timeline in the Recents tab of all the notes you take.

Whilst non-linear can be distracting the subject mater, rather than the class is often non-linear and it is identifying the relationships that are important, so I think we need to make use of tiddlywiki’s non-lineir nature whilst assisting linear activities.

\*I think this may be important when you are doing a number of simultaneous classes, where one moves quickly to the next on a timetable, I am unlikely to be undertaking too many subjects at once. But we do need to cater for these different learning circumstances.

Hi [@TW\_Tones](https://talk.tiddlywiki.org/u/tw_tones)!

The right structure, of course, depends on the subject matter, the level, and your own temperament. ![:slight_smile:](../03%20-%20MEDIA%20&%20FILES/eba8244de357e7b93373e85af016f560_MD5.png ":slight_smile:")

Obviously there are notational tools specific to technical fields, such as math, and study tools specific to memorization-heavy fields such as languages.

If the course has a significant reading list and/or needs you to work with research and citations, go ahead and set up refnotes and learn your way around it. I now use it in all my teaching sites.

If the course relies on lots of concepts and definitions, mock up a good working glossary system in advance. I love a glossary that offers a single-tiddler overview (gleaning the first paragraph from each definition tiddler). Then in the tiddler for a given term, I can go into more depth with examples, clarification comments, etc., after that first definition line. Here’s an example: [PHIL270 — Environmental Philosophy notes 16](https://phil270.tiddlyhost.com/#glossary)

If I were a student, I think I’d try enabling freelinks (freelinking to any destination tiddlers tagged person or tagged concept, or whatever other category ends up being central). That way, while you’re looking at notes on unfamiliar material, you’ll automatically see an inline link to each of the granular bits you’ve already got a node for.

Since you’re already so fluent with TiddlyWiki tricks, I suspect you come to this with plenty of insight about how to set up view templates, etc., to ensure that any tiddler is a hub, from which all important connections are automatically easy to access.

One thing I added to my teaching wikis, just this semester, is blackboard /whiteboard photos (and these are loaded via url via \_canonical\_uri in dedicated tiddlers, but their name gets them automatically displayed at the corresponding session notes). Many students seem to enjoy the ability to jog their memory about what our discussion was like by looking at the blackboard/whiteboard image(s). I’m actually somewhat reluctant to advertise these to students who were absent, because without my gesticulating in front of it, it could be a bit disorienting. Still, with a disclaimer about needing context from discussion, it might be useful even to them in cueing them to ask about elements of whatever ended up on the board.

Here’s a recent example of a session-notes tiddler (constructed from my teaching vantage-point, but perhaps not terribly different from what an attentive student would generate). It includes view-template elements for texts referenced, vocabulary discussed, and whiteboard image from the session, added after the fact: [PHIL270 — Environmental Philosophy notes 12](https://phil270.tiddlyhost.com/#2024-04-04)

If you’re a visual learner, harness some procrastination energy (between content-oriented study sessions) to add some of the graphic bits that help you learn: author photos, book covers, diagrams, etc.

I’m currently majoring in pharma. chemistry, and I’ve been using TW for year and a half for taking notes for all of my courses; while I still use paper and pencil, most of the concepts, examples, diagrams, etc., are kept/eventually end up in TW.

My setup must be offline-first, because one can’t trust wifi/mobile data while at the uni, especially since Everybody Is Watching Tiktok Everywhere All The Time.

I use an iPad + external keyboard to take notes while in the classroom, mostly because the iPad is the only device with enough battery life to last the whole day without recharging. I use the Quine2 app, which lets me edit local tiddlywiki files

At home I use a regular desktop, also editing a local version of the tiddlywiki. I keep those two versions synchronized using syncthing (vanilla syncthing on desktop, [https://www.mobiussync.com/ 6](https://www.mobiussync.com/) in the iPad).

-   Katex
-   CodeMirror, and its vim plugin (you don’t really need it, but since I use vim, having this in TW makes typing more comfortable.)

I thought Refnotes would be handy, but I haven’t used it much, since importing references has been cumbersome, as well as generating bibliographies in different styles; I keep all my references in Zotero, and I use APA to put manual citations in TW when I deem it necessary.

The tiddlers for each session also have an special template and their title follows a convention that allows me to sort them easily and link to the next/previous session:

I also extended the edit template for those tiddlers, to add to them a form for creating tasks; with this I can easily create a new task with its due date, without having to navigate to the Projectify project tiddler.

I **don’t** use tags to categorize knowledge. I use them to identify different **types** of tiddlers; for example, any tiddler tagged “regulation” will have a “year” field, and a “URL” field, and a “issuer” field, and it will likely have a template associated to it which will use those fields.

For organizing knowledge, I mostly rely on links and backlinks; I try to be mindful of when to link (and therefore, to connect) two tiddlers, since I won’t link every place that mentions, say, the word “acid” to the “acid” tiddler. Also, I make a difference between “a tiddler links to this other tiddler”, and “a *session* tiddler links to this other tiddler”:

When that fails me for finding a piece of info, I use the search box, and if I deem it necessary I create a link between the tiddler where I expected the connection to be available, to the formerly disconnected tiddler.

all images are external; this makes it a bit cumbersome to add them, but makes the decision of adding them or not much easier, since I don’t fret about “omygosh my tw is growing so much … can I afford 200K for this?”

as of now, after 18 months of work, I have:

-   ~4200 tiddlers
-   75 MB total size, including images
-   Total TW size: 7.2 MB

I’ve split my tiddlywiki in 3 files: one for core tiddlywiki, one for plugins, one for TW content.

I’ve of course disabled autosave, and save manually, and the difference in responsiveness shows; while saving isn’t specially slow, it’s somewhat annoying after confirming changes to every tiddler.

I keep cheatsheets for TW/plugin functionality that I haven’t learned by heart and I use somewhat frequently.

I’ve considered getting a laptop with good battery life, but decided against it because I must use ergonomic keyboards; currently I use a Keyboardio Atreus, which is portable enough for my needs, and since I use a tablet I get to put the Atreus in the space a regular laptop keyboard would use.
