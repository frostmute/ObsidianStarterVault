How this came about, how you can help:

This document is a resource for assessing the accuracy or veracity of online information, organized under a number of headings. The objective of the resource is to improve the digital lives of individuals and to improve the quality of the online commons by increasing the number of people who know how to separate good info from bad information. It began as a chapter for my 2012 book, [Net Smart: How to Thrive Online](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/9780262017459_sch_0001.pdf). 
 
I wrote the book to improve the quality of the commons and lives of individuals by introducing them to five fundamental literacies. In the order I presented them, these literacies involve skills (both individual and social) having to do with attention, crap    detection, participation, collaboration, and network know-how. Attention came first because it is basic to thought and communication of any kind. Crap detection came next because we have lived since the invention of the search engine in a world where almost everybody almost everywhere can ask any question and receive many answers in a fraction of a second -- however, after millennia of vesting authority in the authors of texts, it is now up to the information seeker/user to decide whether the answers they receive are accurate, inaccurate, outright bogus, or deliberately misleading.  
	
In addition to writing the book, I’ve made available a [syllabus for others to adopt and modify.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17sEK1PBwi1Pfzu9jH5Y6nd0XoxDDTa12PlLPhqay47w/edit) Access to all the published information in the world is a danger rather than a benefit to those who don’t know how to test it. Here are some tools that anybody can use to judge the quality of online information. If you have a suggestion for an additional resource, criticism of an existing resource, suggested correction, you can email [[mailto:howard@rheingold.com|howard@rheingold.com]]. First, make sure that what you want to add is an effective tool. Then, make sure that  your candidate resource isn’t already here.

[Most of the Information We Spread Online is Quantifiably “Bullshit”](http://qz.com/572269/most-of-the-information-we-spread-online-is-quantifiably-bullshit/)

Essay by Professor Nathaniel Barr of the University of Waterloo: “In his well-known essay [On Bullshit](http://www.stoa.org.uk/topics/bullshit/pdf/on-bullshit.pdf), Harry Frankfurt defines bullshit as speech that is designed to impress but lacks a direct concern for the truth. Under such a definition, a large portion of what we read online today is likely to be bullshit.”

	

[http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/12/why-people-believe-meaningless-nonsense.html](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/12/why-people-believe-meaningless-nonsense.html)

“Bullshit, as the philosopher Harry Frankfurt defined it in his [influential 2005 book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691122946?redirect=true&tag=ut056-20) On Bullshit, isn’t the same thing as a lie. When a lie is told, the speaker knows it to be untrue. When bullshit is spewed, on the other hand, the speaker simply doesn’t care if it’s true. So if I were to tell you, right now, “I’m typing this article up on a typewriter rather than a laptop,” that would be a lie. If I were to say something like, “Some of the components in my computer were manufactured in Taiwan,” that would qualify as bullshit because I didn’t check beforehand and didn’t care about the veracity of the statement before uttering it.”

[Facts We Can Believe In: How to Make Fact-Checking Better](http://www.li.com/activities/publications/facts-we-can-believe-in-how-to-make-fact-checking-better)

“‘Fact-checking’ has become an increasingly popular way to fight back against the deluge of disinformation. Having originated in the US, the movement is growing throughout the world, from the information wars of Ukraine through to the Middle East and Latin America. It is a young discipline still working out how it can maximise its impact. In this paper we look at the different methodologies of two of the most advanced fact-checking organisations, Politifact and Full Fact, and see what lessons can be drawn from their experiences during the US Primaries and EU Referendum. We then look at the latest technological innovations in fact-checking, and make recommendations for how best to develop fact-checking across the world and especially in those countries and communities most at risk from the spread of false information.”

How did students decide what to believe? One factor loomed largest: a site's placement in the search results. Students ignored the sponsoring organization and the article's author, blindly trusting the search engine to put the most reliable results first.”
