# Supplemental Reading for Updating Mobile Apps

# Mobile App Packages: App Updates

In this reading, you will learn about updating apps on mobile devices. IT Support professionals use this skill for the maintenance and troubleshooting of mobile devices. It is a best practice to keep apps updated for security purposes and to avoid any problems that affect outdated apps.  

## How to update apps

### Android mobile apps

It is important to note that Android is an open operating system (OS). This means mobile device manufacturers and cellular service providers can modify the Android OS to enhance, control, or restrict elements of the OS. These modifications can include how system settings are accessed. If an Android device’s Storage settings cannot be located easily, it is best to consult the device manufacturer’s manual. Mobile device manuals can often be found online.

Instructions for most Android phones and tablets *(note that instructions may vary by OS version; Android 12 was used for these instructions)*:

**Automatic updates**

1.  Open the **Google Play Store** app.
    
2.  At the top right, tap the **profile icon**.
    
3.  Select **Settings**. 
    
4.  Open the sub-menu for **Network preferences**. 
    
5.  Select an option:
    
    1.  **App download preference** Over any network - to update apps using either Wi-Fi or mobile data (data usage charges may apply, depending on cellular plan).
        
    2.  **Auto-update apps** Over Wi-Fi only - to update apps only when connected to Wi-Fi.
        

**Troubleshooting note:** If the user is not logged in to their Google account on the Android device, apps may not update automatically.

**Manual updates**

1.  If automatic updates are toggled on, repeat steps 1 to 5 for the “Automatic updates” instructions listed above. However, for step 5, select **Don’t auto-update apps**.
    
2.  Open the **Google Play Store** app.
    
3.  At the top right, tap the **profile icon**.
    
4.  Select **Manage apps & device**. 
    
5.  In the Update available section, select See details.
    
6.  Select individual software to Update.
    

## Apple mobile devices

**Automatic updates**

Apple’s iPhones and iPads are configured by default to automatically update apps stored on these devices. However, as an IT Support specialist, you may encounter a variety of reasons why automatic updates were disabled for a device, but need to be enabled again. The instructions to turn on automatic updates for installed apps may vary by OS version. Please see Apple’s website to view instructions for the specific OS version in use. 

**Manual updates**

Some IT departments have policies to test all updates before allowing the updates to be applied across the organization’s devices. In this case, you may need to configure the organization’s Apple mobile devices to use manual updates for apps. Turning on manual updates will involve turning off automatic updates. This step enables notifications to display each time an update becomes available for an app installed on the device. 

**Instructions for app updates**

The instructions for configuring automatic and manual updates for installed apps may vary by OS version. Please see the “Resources for more information” section below for links to Apple’s Support website to obtain detailed instructions.
