🌟 Design

  

Random design tip that I don’t know where to put for now:

Designing a balanced, consistent logo garden: search “[name] logo svg”. Put them all in the same artboard and optically adjust each logo within the artboard so they feel balanced. I usually start by setting a max width for horizontal icons and max height for square/more vertical ones, then adjust if needed. Export artboards as SVGs.

My top 10 typography tips:

- Establish sizes for a hierarchy H1-H6, links, and body text without using any color. then, apply color/font weight/text decoration/letter spacing etc. to text and links as needed to convey functionality or a certain purpose e.g. I see students underline things that aren’t clickable, but it looks like a link
    
- Try to use as few type styles as possible for consistency. Setting up a type system before designing will help. I often see students using 3 different sizes for body copy, 2 different colors for links and 5 heading sizes... your designs will look better and your user will learn how to navigate through your site better if things are consistent!
    
- To set up your type sizes and hierarchy, you can get started with a type scale tool like [modularscale.com](https://www.modularscale.com/) or [type-scale.com](https://type-scale.com/)
    
- Avoid using display fonts for body copy or things longer than a sentence or two
    
- Left align text longer than a sentence or two for readability. You shouldn’t center paragraph text, and [“say no to justification on the web”](https://designforhackers.com/blog/justify-text-html-css/)! Just don’t do it.
    
- Body copy should be at least 16px, 18-21px is even better.
    
- Give body copy line-height of 1.2-1.5 at least for legibility. To meet W3C accessibility guidelines “Line height is at least space-and-a-half within paragraphs—that’s 150%.”
    
- Longer line lengths = more line height, short line lengths = less
    
- Headings tend to be larger and bolder than other elements to stand out. A good way to think about type hierarchy is: what needs to stand out most on the page?
    
- Pair a serif with a sans, sans with sans, but be careful with serif and serif unless you know what you’re doing and have a vision lol

[Contract Creator — Freelancers Union](https://www.freelancersunion.org/contract/) ★

  

Contract

ALWAYS USE A CONTRACT. I repeat, DO NOT WORK WITHOUT A CONTRACT. Even if it’s a “quick gig” or project for a friend. After your first call where you gather the project overview and objectives, send a proposal outlining the scope of the project (what you will do, in X amount of time). Sometimes they’ll give you a strict timeline — in that case, tell them what you will accomplish in that timeframe and lay it out on a timeline. Get them to agree to it in writing, and then send them a contract. Sometimes, I send the proposal and contract together. Whenever possible, get 50% payment upfront.

  

🧠 Most important tips I learned while freelancing:

- Define scope upfront: decide what this project will and — v important — will NOT include. 
    
- Any requests outside of scope should be charged at your hourly rate. Avoid scope creep, and stand your ground on only doing work that is within scope — otherwise you could have a never ending, dragged out project that lasts 8 months when you thought it would only take 1-2 🙃
    
- Double the time you think it’ll take. Triple your rate. If they push back on your rate/project fee, it’s a good thing. You can always reduce the scope of work to fit their budget, but don’t reduce your rate — it could come off like you don’t value your own services and your worth.
    
- Ask other designers doing similar work how much they charge. You’re probably not asking for enough 🤑
    

  

I usually send a Proposal and Scope of Work (SOW)—if you plan on working with the client again in the future, you can send a Master Services Agreement (MSA) and a new SOW per project.

What it’s like to work at…

[https://airbnb.design/first-day-to-first-launch/](https://airbnb.design/first-day-to-first-launch/)

  

Writing a bio

🚫a UX Designer with a desire to empower users through emphatic storytelling & intuitive design.  
🚫Designer with a passion for all things visual.

🚫I make beautiful, intuitive pixel-perfect user interfaces  
  
Tip #1: How can you make your bio uniquely yours? Bios can be one of the toughest things to write, but spending time making yours unique is worth it. I’ve given feedback on hundreds of portfolios in the past couple years, and see the same bios over and over. The same buzzwords: passion, empathetic, storytelling, empower users, intuitive, clean, delightful experiences, etc.  
  
Tip #2: Important! Make sure you call yourself what you want to be hired for and show work that’s related to that role. People that look at your portfolio will want to come away with a sense of “this is what that person does, and I can hire them for it” and it’s tough when you show 10 different projects that aren’t related to the job you want e.g. product designer. Show work that is specific to the role you want, and call yourself that role. Note for early career designers: I encourage dropping “Junior” in front of your title everywhere. Just say Designer. People will look at your years of experience and determine if they think you’re a good fit, but I wouldn’t start by underselling yourself by presenting yourself as “junior” explicitly.

Babbel ★ — surprisingly good, for something a little more “serious” than Duolingo

 NEW [Japanese with Hikari](https://www.japanesewithhikari.com) ★ — I love her Tiktoks! I signed up for her course which has a Discord server that she is active in. I am relearning Japanese as of 2023. I studied it for 7 years up until 2015, but whether you have any background or not this is a great way to learn!
