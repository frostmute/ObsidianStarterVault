## How to choose a digital note-taking and personal knowledge management software: acknowledging the analysis paralysis and overwhelm

When you’re getting started with digital note-taking (or if you’ve been at it a while), it can be easy to get overwhelmed by the choice of software. There are some amazing apps out there right now, with new ones emerging on what seems like a daily basis. Should you go with [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)? [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)? [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/)? [Craft](https://www.craft.do/)? [Bear](https://bear.app/)? [SuperNotes](https://supernotes.app/)? [Logseq](https://logseq.com/)? [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/)? The list feels endless and overwhelming… it’s enough to make you throw your hands up in the air and just keep on scribbling ideas on random post-it notes you just know you’re doing to lose in the depths of your desk drawers.

**Even if you try to be methodical and focus on specific software features – how do you choose?** [Bidirectional](https://nesslabs.com/notion-backlinks) [linking](https://maggieappleton.com/bidirectionals) (aka creating a personal wiki or [mind garden](https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/mind-gardening-organise-thoughts-increase-productivity)) is trendy right now. But tags and folders are other established ways to organize information too – and those might feel more natural to the way you think. Or what about simple, reliable full-text search?

**What do you prioritize?** Operating system? Privacy? Being able to access your [notes from work](https://elizabethbutlermd.com/take-good-notes-at-work/)? From a school or library computer? Do you want your note in the cloud, or to keep them on your own machine only? Do you need to share your notes with anyone? Do you need access to your PKM system on your phone or tablet?

## Feeling pressure to pick the “right” software

You can feel a great deal of pressure, trying to choose the right software – because there are time costs involved. And depending on the software, likely financial costs as well. You’re a busy person – you don’t want to be fighting with new software every month, importing and exporting data. **You just want a solution that *works* so you can get on with your primary projects.** (Which most likely do not revolve around wrangling your [personal knowledge management](https://elizabethbutlermd.com/6-ways-that-personal-knowledge-management-is-like-yoga-for-your-mind/) system.)

### Bright shiny object syndrome

You jump with both feet into the next new thing that crosses your Twitter feed. You know you suffer from “bright shiny object” syndrome, and are constantly optimistic that the next software you try will finally be the one that solves all your PKM frustrations and challenges. You end up having notes scattered across many different apps, and you spend way too long searching to find stuff. You periodically amalgamate your notes into one new piece of software, but inevitably you can’t keep up.

## Here’s the solution: focus on developing a PKM system rather than choosing PKM software

### High level vs ground up approach

When you start out focusing on software, you’re working from the ground up. You’re taking software and **trying to make your needs fit into its features, instead of the other way around**.

### Start with your system, not the software

To start with the system, you make a mindful, deliberate plan based on the following questions:

-   What are your personal knowledge management goals?
-   What do you want to achieve?
-   What types of information you need to organize?
-   What are your outcomes and deliverables?

Starting with these foundational questions will help you gain clarity. You’ll build a system that actually suits your PKM needs – instead of being distracted by the bells and whistles of the next exciting new note taking software.
