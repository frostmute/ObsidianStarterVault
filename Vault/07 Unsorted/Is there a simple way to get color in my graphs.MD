-   go to Graph View
    
-   click the box or gear icon in the top-left corner of the graph view, you should see a "Groups" section in the menu
    
-   click the "New Group" button
    
-   you can double-click in the text box for help
    

Now there are various ways to do this.

-   If you want to set a color for all the files with the tag #cool, type `tag:#cool`
    
-   If you want to color all the files whose name begins with "journal", type `file:journal`
    
-   If you want to color all the files in the "private" folder, type `path:private`
    

You can change the color of a group by clicking on the color circle

Can you set a group for multiple tags this way?

Yes.

`tag:#cool OR tag:#interesting`
