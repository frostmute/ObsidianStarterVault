## Hi, I’m Jonathan,

## I Deliver Unique Visual Design, Clear Art Direction, Robust Team Management, and Flawless Technical implementation… among other Things (yeah, I know… I’m One of Those ‘Jacks’)!

#### I Have 20+ Years of Experience Crafting Digital Products, Helping Businesses and Non-profits Greet the World, and Finding Cutting Edge Technical Implementation to Bring it All Together.

### I also Help Artists and Creatives Overcome Mental Health Roadblocks (and other disadvantages) that Might Interfere along the Road to Showing the World Their Amazing Creations!

I founded and run TheWytchHaus, a non-profit organization providing financial support, networking, and representation to local South Texas artists suffering from mental health disorders, substance abuse issues, recent incarceration, extreme poverty, and domestic violence trauma… as well as their family members and dependents.
