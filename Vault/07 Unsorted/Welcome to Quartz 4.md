Quartz is a fast, batteries-included static-site generator that transforms Markdown content into fully functional websites. Thousands of students, developers, and teachers are [already using Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/showcase) to publish personal notes, websites, and [digital gardens](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) to the web.

## ðŸª´ Get Started

Quartz requires **at least [Node](https://nodejs.org/) v18.14** and `npm` v9.3.1 to function correctly. Ensure you have this installed on your machine before continuing.

Then, in your terminal of choice, enter the following commands line by line:

```
<span data-line=""><span>git</span><span> clone</span><span> https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>cd</span><span> quartz</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>npm</span><span> i</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>npx</span><span> quartz</span><span> create</span></span>
```

This will guide you through initializing your Quartz with content. Once youâ€™ve done so, see how to:

1.  [Writing content](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/authoring-content) in Quartz
