“This is great for beginners and those who are not so techie because of it's simple, minimalist and no-frills design.”

“I can't believe you single-handedly built this beautiful app. Great job brother! It's really snappy!”

“Migrant here—have gone through almost all the apps out there, most recently Roam / Craft / Mem / Obsidian. Strangely, even just an hour or so in, I'm getting a sense Notabase is already fulfilling a lot of what I'm looking for: OS interoperability; Markdown exports; clean UI. All of those other apps have faltered in one way or another.”

“Just tested this application today, love how clean it looks!”

“Looks neat, fresh, and clean. Love minimalist style.”
