## Save it now. Read it later.
![[../03 - MEDIA & FILES/landing-01-save-it-now.avif]]
Save articles and PDFs as you come across them using Omnivore's mobile apps and browser extensions. Read them later using our distraction free reader.



## Get all your RSS feeds and newsletters in one place.
![[../03 - MEDIA & FILES/landing-02-newsletters.avif]]
Send newsletters directly to your Omnivore library rather than scattered across multiple inboxes. Read them on your own time, away from the constant distractions and interruptions of your email.



## Keep your reading organized, whatever that means to you.
![[../03 - MEDIA & FILES/landing-03-organisation.avif]]
Keep your reading organized and easily available with labels, filters, rules, and ful text searches. We're not here to tell you how to stay organized — our job is to give you the tools to build a system that works for you.



## Add highlights and notes.
![[../03 - MEDIA & FILES/landing-04-highlights-and-notes.avif]]
Highlight key sections and add notes as you read. You can access your highlights and notes any time — they stay with your articles forever.



## Sync with your second brain.
![[../03 - MEDIA & FILES/landing-05-sync.avif]]
Omnivore syncs with popular Personal Knowledge Management systems including Logseq, Obsidian, and Notion, so you can pull all your saved reading, highlights, and notes into your second brain.



## Listen to your reading with text-to-speech.
![[../03 - MEDIA & FILES/landing-06-tts.avif]]
Work through your to-be-read list and give your eyes a break with text-to-speech, exclusively in the Omnivore app for iOS. Realistic, natural-sounding AI voices will read any saved article aloud.



## Open source means you're in control.
![[../03 - MEDIA & FILES/landing-07-oss.avif]]
Reading is a lifetime activity, and you shouldn't have to worry you'll lose your library after you've spent years building it. Our open-source platform ensures your reading won't be held prisoner in a proprietary system.
