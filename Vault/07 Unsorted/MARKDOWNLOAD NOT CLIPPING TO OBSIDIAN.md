According to a GitHub issue, MarkDownload may not be able to save images directly to an Obsidian vault using "Copy selection as markdown". However, some say that MarkDownload can almost always capture what is desired, but it may require some extra work to get it into Obsidian. Here are some steps to clip MarkDown to Obsidian:

1.  In the browser extension's preferences, turn off Always show Save As dialog and turn on Download Images alongside markdown files
2.  Enable Obsidian Integration and specify the vault name and inbox as the Obsidian folder
3.  Go to the desired web page, right-click, and select MarkDownload → Send tab to Obsidian

    Clipping Articles into Obsidian
    
    Aug 25, 2023 — It does one thing, and it does it well. The downside is that it's not yet integrated with Obsidian. There is no one-click “save to Obsidian”. They are working on that, but it's a tricky problem, and there's no telling if or when it will be released. If you use MarkDownload, you can trust that it will almost always capture what you want. But it requires a little more leg work to get it into Obsidian. In my own testing, I found that rather than clicking the “Download” button, I prefer to click the MarkDownload button and copy the text straight from the plugin popup itself (see below). Then I paste it into Obsidian.

    Issues list. Part of the page is missing. ... Code blocks still unreadable after #312. ... MarkDownload can't save images directly to an Obsidian vault via "Copy selection as markdown" ... Markdown clip download fails if website does not have a 'title' tag. ... Image filename prefix template with {pageTitle} ignores changes to pageTitle. ... Add possibility to define trimming rules and then trim superfluous parts of markdown produced based on them, automatically (based on URL) or as a button. ... Does this work on ChromeOS? ... Images cannot be displayed. ... Better Android support: scale interface to full viewport width & height.
    

    

Some other tips for using MarkDownload include:

-   Selecting text on a page and clicking the Markdown icon to clip the selected text or the entire document
-   Clicking the Download Selected button in the popup to download only the selected section of text
-   Clicking the Markdown icon in the browser's extension area to show a popup with the current website as Markdown
-   Making edits to the content or title before clicking the Download button
