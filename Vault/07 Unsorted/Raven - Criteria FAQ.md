Commonly asked questions

Criteria

Does the order of the criteria list matter? Is the first criterion more important than the second and so on?

→ The order of the criteria list is not important and criteria that are first in the list should not be considered more imperative than criteria later in the list. You can organize the criteria list in whichever manner makes sense to you.

Does the subject language of the criteria need to be consistent for each item in the criteria list? Let’s say the prompt requests the model to generate a poem and Criteria 1 says “The response should…” does Criteria 2 need to also say “The response should…” or can it use a different subject such as “The poem should…” ?

→ While you might find it helpful to maintain consistency with the language used in the criteria list, it’s not a requirement.

When providing an example for a subjective criterion, does the language “For example” need to be used, or can I vary how I give the example?

→ You must use the exact wording “For example” before each example.

If criteria are present in earlier turns of a conversation, do I need to repeat those criteria for the current prompt if it still requires them?

→ Yes, previous criteria that would be needed to produce a good answer for the current prompt need to be represented. However, avoid creating a long list of what you consider might be important from previous turns in the conversation and focus only on criteria that would be needed for the model to generate a good response.

Is there a minimum criteria amount needed for a prompt?

→ There is no minimum, but consider that there might be implicit criteria and criteria that can be broken down into further fine-grained atomic components. If you find yourself only including one or two criteria for a prompt, take a look again to see if anything can be broken down even further.

Model capability

When the model takes on a persona, can it act like it has a body/can do things in the real world?

→ A persona should be reflected in how the models respond to a prompt and not that it can act like it has a body.

If the model responds to a prompt saying it can’t do something, should I believe it?

→ In general you should believe the model when it says it can’t do something, within reasonable assumptions (for example if the model says it can’t write a poem, that is obviously untrue).

Can the model follow links or access a specific website?

→ Unless indicated otherwise, the model can follow links and can access specific websites if instructed to do so. However, if the model says it can’t follow a link then you should believe what it says.

Does the model know the user’s location?

→ Assume the model is behaving reasonably if it acts like it knows the user’s location (this only applies to the original prompter, it won’t know your location if you’re working on our site)

What is the line for NSFW material that the model can generate?

→ At this moment, we don’t have strictly defined guidelines so you should use your best judgement and avoid anything that most would consider objectionable. Things that should generally be avoided:

-   Self harm
-   Aiding in illegal activities
-   Terrorism or violence
-   Medical/legal/financial advice
-   Hate speech or discriminatory language
-   Extremely pornographic sexual depictions

What is the line for the models offering medical or professional advice?

→ There’s also not a firm line here, so use your best judgement. For example, if the advice is something you might worry about getting sued for if someone followed the advice and ended up having a bad reaction or a bad outcome, then it’s best to avoid the topic. For example, asking on how to increase the dosage of a prescribed medication would not be acceptable, but asking for advice on how to clean a simple cut would be fine.
