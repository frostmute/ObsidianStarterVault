title: "What are y'all doing about images and your vault file size? : r/ObsidianMD"
description: "Hey everyone! I've been using Obsidian since the beginning of the year and have been incorporating various uses of images into my use of the software. I keep all the image files in a singular folder which keeps things easy to organize, and display images by linking to them ![[file_name_of_image]]. So far, my Images folder is 100 MBs, the entire size of my vault is 121 MB. This doesn't really surprise me as MD files are super small, but it does concern me a little bit for the future of my vault and it's file size. I'm not exactly adding images like crazy into Obsidian, but who knows what could happen in the future. How are y'all managing your images / vault size? Are you concerned at all about this? Are there alternative ways of displaying images that might help with vault size?"
