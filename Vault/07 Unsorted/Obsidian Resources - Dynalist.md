[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (in case you don't know why you're here)

A very good introductory video on getting started with Obsidian. Highly recommended if you are coming for the first time and have no idea where to start.

Curtis has been walking through many of the revisions of Obsidian as we go. A good introduction and also a great peek at the way the program has evolved in a very short time.

Another one from Curtis McHale, but this one is specifically a good introduction and demonstration of how connecting notes works.

Ren gives a great introduction for students, in the context of a comparison of features with Roam.

This one is a good overview on how and why connected notes are powerful, and how they work in Obsidian.

An ongoing series about doing specific things with Obsidian

Effective Remote Work talks about using 1Writer on iOS with Obsidian

Not specific to Obsidian, but an excellent introduction to Zettelkasten, which uses Obsidian for the examples. If you watch that, the [followup video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TnUNN39NBU) is worth continuing with.

A good demonstration of how he uses MOC's, Indexes, and Daily Notes to keep organized. As a bonus, the opening slide show is done using Obsidian's slide feature!

Much of Justin's stuff is useful, but I list this one specifically as an excellent introduction to markdown, and how to use it effectively to take notes.

The Productivity Guru talking about the advance search options available from v.0.8.0. Contains a lot of details and examples on how to use regex in Obsidian (also useful for general regex knowledge).

A good overview of how one person implemented Zettelkasten in Obsidian, specifically using multiple folders for categorization.

Scripts And External Tools

A small collection of scripts for engaging with collections of markdown files. Includes a compiled todo list, a daily note, and cleaning up empty notes.

A python script that will auto-created forward linking within a vault.

Not specifically for Obsidian, but works well with it, this script compiles an agenda from a specifically formatted collection of markdown files. A good starting point for making your own.

The original github repo from which we built our Community Themes. Also has some additional CSS tweaks and links to other resources.

Obsidian SASS theme switching tools from [@death\_au](https://dynalist.io/d/CQ4V16tFhIJIfy-rgDK7r1Bp# "Filter @death_au"). Kind of advanced, not officially supported, but a cool trick if you want to try to pull it off.
