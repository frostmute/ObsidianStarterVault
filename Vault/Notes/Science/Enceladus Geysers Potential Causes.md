# Enceladus geysers potential causes
**Overview**
Description:: Geysers on Enceladus are potentially caused by cooling cycles, tidal forces, pressure, frictional heating...

## Note
The geysers on Enceladus are likely caused by tidal heating, a process where gravitational interactions with Saturn and nearby moons generate heat inside Enceladus. This heat melts its icy interior, causing water to erupt through the surface as geysers when pressure builds up.
